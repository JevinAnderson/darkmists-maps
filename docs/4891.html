  <h1>First Floor</h1>
  <pre>The floor has been remade, and is beautiful. A mosaic of color greets your
eyes as you look down at it. Bits of lapis, malachite, garnet, tiger's eye,
swirl and dance in a design of color. The surface of the floor is smooth,
each stone having been polished, but not so smooth as to induce slipping and
falling. The black-veined white marble walls are smooth and polished, gleam-
ing in the available light. Nothing adorns these walls, however.
A golden staircase leads upward. It is polished to a fine shine, and appears
to be in good condition.</pre>
