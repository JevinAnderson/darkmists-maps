  <h1>Research Room</h1>
  <pre>The floor is made of finely polished oak panels in a delicate parquet
design. The walls shine in the light of several candles in pretty cast
iron sconces. You count thirteen of them. This room half-circles around
the main section of this storey. The doorway remains open, leading to
the west.</pre>
