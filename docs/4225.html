  <h1>The Cavern of Recuperation</h1>
  <pre>Runes line the walls and floor of this dark cavern as they do the others, with
one small exception.  The runes appear to be both unholy and holy in origin,
leading one to wonder just exactly what kind of warped deeds take place in
this place.  At the center of the cavern is a large runic circle, covered in
both shapes and figures.  Standing in its midst is a large hooded figure, who
looks like he or she...or it?  is not to be trifled with.</pre>
