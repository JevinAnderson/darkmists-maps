  <h1>Common Room: Circle of Dawn</h1>
  <pre>This room is rather bright and airy.  A row of windows look out into the
forest, and let a significant amount of air in, as well as sunshine when the
sun is out.  Potted plants and soft rugs have been placed around the room for
aesthetics.  Thick tables have been placed here so that people may converse or
study, and soft velvet couches provide a cushioned seat for a well needed
rest.  A small fountain is set in the side of the wall, to provide the
harmonious sound of trickling and splashing water to help soothe the weary
minds of the magi of the tower.</pre>
