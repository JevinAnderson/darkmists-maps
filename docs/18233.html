  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path stretches before you to the east
and west. To the north and south of the path, you see
thin trunked trees with smooth grey, peeling bark
lending an intermittant shade to all around you. Thick,
large-leaved shrubs grow between the tree trunks, and
dark green ivy with large leaves covers the ground.
Along the south side of the path, a stream flows toward
the east. It gurgles from under a slab of rock to the
west toward another such slab of rock to the east.</pre>
