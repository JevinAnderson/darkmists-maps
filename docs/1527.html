  <h1>Dungeon</h1>
  <pre>Like most dungeons, this dungeon is not well lit, has bars and
locks, and smells a bit funny.  Unlike most dungeons though,
this dungeon actually tries to let the prisoners feel comfortable,
though not too comfortable.  A long, lightly padded bench mounted
to the wall and hanging from chains and a couple of immobile,
enchanted buckets for latrines adorn the cell.</pre>
