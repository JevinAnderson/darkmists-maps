    <h1 class="room-header">On a dark path</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">The hard path below you is liberally covered with soil, but clearly stone-
based. It stretches to the north and south. On either side of you to the east
and west are thick woods. Nestled within the woods to the west is a sturdy
cottage, a neat pathway of smooth white stones leading to the open doorway.
A canopy of leaves arcs over the pathway of white stones to the west as well
as over this main path, lending a lovely shade but also darkening the way.
At the edges of the path, small plants grow, their leaves a light green, their
tiny flowers a pretty light violet. The buzzing of bees is audible here,
though only once in a while do you see a bee sipping the nectar from a tiny
violet bloom. Beyond those little plants, there are lush green shrubs bearing
sweet berries.</pre>
