  <h1>Shrine to Gryleth</h1>
  <pre>A few pebbles on the dark floor of this alcove testify to the fact that nobody
has really been careful about cleaning. The smooth striated walls have become
home to glowing lichen which clings in small streaks, giving light in hues of
brilliant orange and gold. The high ceiling is dark. In the center of the room
is an iron anvil, brought in from somewhere out there, certainly forged by
someone's hands, though whether those hands were mortal or divine is a subject
for discussion. Its darkness is a contrast to the brightness of the colored
lichen all around. Upon its surface lay the implements of a blacksmith, forged
of steel. They appear clean and unused, as though waiting for an immortal smith
to lift them and put them to use. Near one end of the anvil sits a steel mug,
empty. A curious inscription is engraved upon its side.  A vaulted opening leads
to the north.</pre>
