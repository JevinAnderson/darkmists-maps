  <h1>Field</h1>
  <pre>Through the enlightened methods of irrigation, the Lord of the
Manor was able to turn this edge of the desert into usable
cropland. Rows and rows of grain and vegetable crops grow well
here, irrigated from the river to the north. This is the north-
west corner of the field. To the north and west are a wall of
shrubs and trees planted as a windblock for protection of the
fields from the harsh winds of the desert. From the north is
the sound of an occasional splash.</pre>
