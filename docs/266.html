  <h1>A Small Clearing</h1>
  <pre>You stand in a small clearing deep in the Emerald Forest. The ground
shows no evidence of trees being cut down or any other indication
that the clearing is carved from axe or hand, yet the borders seem too
neat to be the result of Mother Nature's whim. In some areas the
shrubs and bushes appear to have gone out of their way (if that is
possible) to align themselves, and the soft wood grass while not having
the blunt heads of a kept garden seem to be growing neatly in line all
by themselves. Strong magic is at work here.</pre>
