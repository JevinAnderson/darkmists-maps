  <h1>A Trail</h1>
  <pre>Pausing a moment from your travels through the Emerald forest,
you hear the gurgling sound of moving water coming from the east,
while to the south the forest continues on with oak, pine and
rosewood. Peering intently toward the source of the sound, you
notice a faint outline of a bridge resting in the shade of the long
leafy branches of the tall, flanking trees.</pre>
