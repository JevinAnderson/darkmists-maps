  <h1>Justicar barracks</h1>
  <pre>The walls of this low room are lined with rows of bunkbeds, packed
tightly together. The dirty stone floor bears a number of worn
pieces of clothing, casually tossed aside by owners in a hurry to meet
their next obligation as lawmen. The bunks themselves, however, are
tightly and uniformly made- sheets tucked firmly beneath the mattress,
pillows on top. Some of the beds have small chests next to them for
personal effects, but they contain nothing of note. The barracks
continue to the south.</pre>
