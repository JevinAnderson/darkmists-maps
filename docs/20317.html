    <pre class="room-description">Three solid walls are lined with various pieces of armor and weapons. The
fourth wall, at the west, has a vaulted opening toward the tunnels. A small
counter formed of striated stone rises up from the floor to the east, not of
a piece with the floor, but brought in from elsewhere. Nature itself formed
it, smoothing its edges and polishing it over time. The high ceiling is also
of the same stone. Glowing lichen covers much of the walls, lending a soft
light to this alcove.</pre>
