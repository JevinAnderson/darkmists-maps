  <h1>Vertigo</h1>
  <pre>You step through the portal to find it seal shut behind you. When you open
your eyes, what you see borders on indescribable.  The walls and floor of
this strange place are in constant flux, spinning and oscillating wildly.
You wonder if you can even gain footing in here to make your way forward.
The walls crackle intensely with psionic energy and seem to register your
unwelcome presence with hostility.  You feel your mind exerting a constant
effort just to keep a strange presence from turning your brain to scrambled
eggs. You feel exhausted from the effort, yet the flow of mana coursing its
way through your body also seems to be increased.  The smell of rotting
things and old mildew is heavy in the air here, and every once in a while,
a strange breeze flows through this "tunnel". Or did you imagine that breeze?
In fact, you're not quite sure if you can trust yoursenses in this place with
any reliability at all. The only direction you can stumble toward is to the
east.</pre>
