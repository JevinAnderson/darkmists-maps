  <h1>Infantry Recreation Room</h1>
  <pre>Infantry are big, strong, and not always smart.  Their way of
solving any problem is to smash it.  As a result, members of
the other factions aren't exactly thrilled at having to share
recreation rooms with them, so this room was built.  Located
across from the library, the room has a mild sound dampener
enchantment cast upon it so as to not disturb those in the
library.  The room is quite tidy, but scratches on the walls
and small piles of smashed furniture betray the quite brutish
nature of the infantry.</pre>
