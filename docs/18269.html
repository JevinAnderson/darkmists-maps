  <h1>The Massive Cavern of the Lady of Purity</h1>
  <pre>Blazing cressets atop natural rock columns light the rocky
walls and floor. The rock floor is bare of any cloth or
fur, and you can see where water has collected in the few
low spots, undoubtedly tracked in from a wet place. More
than a few huge glass-topped tables formed of stone protrude
from the walls, the stone part of the wall, but the glass
obviously added later. Within the tables are collections
of things. Each table is labelled by number.</pre>
