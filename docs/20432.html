  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>A dark canopy of green leaves arcs over the hard path beneath you. To the
east and west are woods, growing thickly, unhindered. The soil-strewn path
stretches northward and southward. Little plants line the path, their light
green and bright yellow blooms lending a little color to the darkness. Berry-
bearing shrubs grow beyond the little flowering plants, their leaves lush and
dark green. You near the buzzing of a honey bee or two, but only rarely do
you see the little insect sipping nectar from one of the pretty yellow
blossoms.</pre>
