  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path extends eastward and westward. From
here you can tell that it encircles a miniature garden, or
perhaps a garden, and forest, in miniature. The sun beats
down upon this part of the garden during the day, for there
are no tall trees to lend shading. To the north of the path,
rocks rise up that have become home to various small, hardy
trees whose weather-toughened trunks have twisted over time
with the winds. Rough roots dig into the boulders, cracking
them. Most of the trees are of the fir and pine variety, with
small, hard green needles and a certain prehistoric look. To
the south, the ground is covered with moss and grasses, and
the small trees growing there are of the deciduous kind, their
branches following the will of the natural seasons, with leaves
budding, growing, turning darker green, then to brilliant golds
and scarlets, and then, brown, falling to the ground and leaving
bare branches to rustle in the winter winds. In miniature, these
trees are exquisite, no matter the season.</pre>
