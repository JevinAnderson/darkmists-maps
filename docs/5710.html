  <h1>Library of the Crusades</h2>
  <pre>Rows and rows of heavy oak book shelves line this warm room. Books of almost
every size, color, age, and topic considered important to a Crusader fill the
shelves. Numerous scrolls are plastered to the walls, lay sprawed out on
tables, or sticking out of cubby holes. A warm glow emanates from the large
brick fireplace at the north end of the library. Large picture blocks with
the alphabet on them lay in many boxes to aid the needs of the many Crusaders
who are "challenged". You notice a librarian working diligently to keep this
place in order.</pre>
