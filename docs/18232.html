  <h1>End of the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path stretches southward from the base of a
rough rock cliff. The land to the south gently inclines, though
the result is to make the path uneven and challenging to walk
upon. The cliff face is craggy, with small, hardy trees attempting
to grow from it. Directly before you, to the north, it seems a
little smoother, as though someone had sought to work the stone
and polish it. To the west and east of the path, lush green grass
grows, soft to the touch of bare feet walking upon it. A few elm
trees, and a couple maples, grow here.</pre>
