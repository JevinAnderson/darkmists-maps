You stand at the perimeter of the largest, most incredible tree that
you have ever laid eyes on.  It has gold-flecked leaves that are the
size of small horses, with thick roots supporting a massive trunk that
is easily twice the size of the grand fortress of the Templar Knights
of Renhorden.  It seems to stretch endlessly into the sky, and you
wonder why you did not see it towering above all the other trees in
the forest.  You long to inch closer, but cannot seem to move beyond
an invisible barrier that keeps you about a hundred yards away.  You
see movement and lights in and about the tree, but there seems to be
no way you can get closer to it.</pre
