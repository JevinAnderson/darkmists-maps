    <h1 class="room-header">The Top of the Northeast Tower</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">Two arcing stone walls, one to the north, one to the south, rise up, and to the
east are four, large, polished, marble pillars coming up from the ground
outside the Keep, all the way to the top of the Tower. The western wall is
filled with a large, beautiful blue curtain of sturdy make. The curtain is
bound by large, polished brass rings allowing it to be closed or opened at
will. A huge, glass roof covers the top of the Tower. This beautiful roof is
held on metal hinges on both sides allowing the roof to be retracted open or
closed at will. The glass is perfectly transparent allowing sunlight or
moonlight to find the bottom of the floor with ease. Completely encircling the
perimeter of the tower floor is a layer of stone, seemingly a second layer to
what was once the first (wall) layer, and high enough to require that you step
over and onto the tower room floor. That floor is covered with moist soil,
thick in mulch, mixed with decaying leaves, through which many plants have
sprouted. The trees which grow here are twisted and bent. Parts of them look
dead, but new growth has sprouted, and the leaves are a healthy green. Some
of the shrubs have also taken a beating, it appears, but they, too, have new
greenery to show for their fight against the elements. Near the twisted trees,
in the center of the soil-filled floor, off to the side of the worn path, is a
construction known as a dakota hole. At the base of the northern wall and the
secondary inner wall, a marble pipe emerges upward, and warm water trickles out
and soaks the ever moist, mulchy soil. The northern wall appears is perfect
shape, even polished of any dirt or blemishes. On the right side of the
northern wall there is a remaining tree leaning heavily against the top of the
wall, its purchase on the shallow floor iffy. The southern wall has small ivy
vines holding grip to the small grooves in the wall, their tiny green leaves
seeking sunlight. A small grouping of pink roses appears to have taken root
near one of the green shrubs. Near another green shrub a small grouping of
yellow tulips grows. A small white lily grows near the base of one of the
smaller trees. A huge grouping of bright orange and yellow flowers grows in
the eastern section among a few small green shrubs. A small sprig of purple
violets grows outside an overturned box and between two green shrubs.</pre>
