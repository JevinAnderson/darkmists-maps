  <h1>Within the herb garden</h1>
  <pre>The smooth stone path extends no farther westward, but continues on eastward
from here. The path's surface is cleanly swept, without sign of stray pebble
or bits of soil. Along the edges where the path and the garden soil meet, a
line of trimming shows where the diligent gardener has kept things tidy.
Small yellow and black striped honeybees buzz and flit about from spicy blos-
som to spicy blossom, collecting nectar and spreading pollen.</pre>
