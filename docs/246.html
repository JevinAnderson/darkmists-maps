  <h1>The Only Stump in the Forest</h1>
  <pre>In this small lonely clearing is an ancient stump.  Many years ago, a
forester callously hewed down a tree here.  In retribution, Altariel,
whose sanctuary the Emerald Forest is, transformed him into a poplar
tree.  The poplar tree stands here beside the stump, its branches cut
by the rangers of the forest whenever they are in need of wood.</pre>
