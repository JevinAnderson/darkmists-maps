    <pre class="room-description">The cylindrical chamber gives way unto a two-level chamber, deep
within the depths of Thera. To the northern end of the chamber, upon
a platform of shiny black obsidian, is an intricately carved pillar.
It is surrounded by a curtain of shadow, flickering, extending through
the ceiling of dark stone. The central platform, running east and west,
is lined with statues - horrific figures of the Brethren, portrayed in
intimate detail. They extend to the east and west of the obsidian dais,
lining the raised platform. Beyond the statues, you can glimpse the
lower hall, the Ahzra In'trea. To the east and west, through the central
hall, a thick splashing noise can be heard. Archways above the dark
passageways bear a disturbing message, obviously directed at intruders.
Steps lead downward another level, extending into the lower tier of
this dark room. The steps are carved from red stone, as though a dull
rendition of ruby. They are heavily carved with archaic sigils, similar
to those covering the rest of the chamber.</pre>
