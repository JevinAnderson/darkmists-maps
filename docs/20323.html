  <h1>Downward sloping path</h1>
  <pre>The path slopes downward toward the south, into a tunnel in the striated
rock. Up here, off the stony path, you see shrubs lush with green growth and
a few tall trees. Near the ground, small wildflowers grow, their bright green
leaves forming a ground cover. The buzzing of honey bees is evident here, but
only once in a while do you see one sipping nectar from the little flowers.
To the north and the east you see a dark, woody area, where the trees have
formed a tunnel of arching branches and a canopy of leaves.</pre>
