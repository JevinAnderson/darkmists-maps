  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural stone path meanders northward and southward, and branches
off eastward. Veering eastward or southward, a stream of water flows
with a pleasant gurgle. High, thick, coarse-barked trees spread a bit
of shade beneath their thick canopies of leaves. Closer to the ground,
thick shrubs fill the air with that fresh, green fragrance.</pre>
