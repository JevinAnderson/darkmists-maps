  <h1>In the Center of the Oasis</h1>
  <pre>You stand in the center of the oasis. A large clear pond lies here in
stark contrast to the blistering heat and sand that surrounds the oasis.
Dates and figs hang ripe from the trees as they hang over the pond,
protecting it from the harsh desert sun. Tropical birds chirp away as
they dive into the water to grab a quick drink. Evidence of humanity is
everywhere. Clothes dripping from makeshift clothing lines while baskets
of woven hemp scattered here and there filled with all manners of items.
Sounds of people laughing and shouting can be heard coming from all around.</pre>
