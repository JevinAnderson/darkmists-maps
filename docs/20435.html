  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>Extending toward east and west, the soil-strewn, rock hard path is darkened
by arching branches and a full canopy of leaves forming a tunnel. The trunks
of the lush trees act as structural guidance to a pair of 'walls' formed by
many shrubs growing thick and uninhibited on the north and south sides of
the path. Bright pink flowers grow close to the ground, lending color to the
darkness.</pre>
