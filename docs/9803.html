  <h1>An Intersection</h1>
  <pre>Four different halls branch out of this room. One leads back
towards the entrance and to the hall of white marble. One leads
to the north; out of that path comes the smell of alcohol and
cooking meat. A ladder leads up into a hole in the ceiling;
flickering shadows can be seen crossing across the hole. To the
south there is the sound of silence. No movement, no talking, no
activity of any kind comes from there.</pre>
