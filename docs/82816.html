  <h1>The Southeast Turret</h1>
  <pre>The turret is simple in adornment, and meant to serve a specific purpose.
it grants a view of the grounds around the castle, so that intruders can
be watched for.  This turrent grants a fine view of the marketplace of
Lacunae.  And also allows for the castle to have a perfect view of the
path leading to the walls as well. The fine marble of the rest of the
place is not to be found here.  Only the soft blue carpets still look
like the rest.  The stairs lead back down to the castle proper, and
are also covered in the fine blue carpetting.</pre>
