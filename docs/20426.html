  <h1>By the pond</h1>
  <pre>The hard soil-strewn path stretches toward the east and west. Bordering it on
the north is a crystalline blue pond, its waters mostly still. Along the edge
of the pond, water herbs grow. The grass is green along the path. Occasionally
you notice a little movement beneath the surface of the pond water, and you
can see some silvery fish swimming. The path also branches to the south,
toward a darker, more foresty area.</pre>
