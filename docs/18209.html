  <h1>End of the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path leads to the east. To north, west, and
south are huge trees, giant redwoods, thick as nine giants
in a huddle together. So close do they grow to one another
that there is no room for shrubs. Smaller plants seem to be
attempting to grow here in the moist soil, though. A small
stone bench is here, angled to enjoy the shade of the mighty
redwoods.</pre>
