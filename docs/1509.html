  <h1>A Dark Hallway</h1>
  <pre>The hallway is fairly bland and the only things to see are the
everburning torches lining the walls.  It is very quiet in here,
the only sounds that can be heard are the echoes from your own
movements.  To the east lies a very strange room that appears
to be a miniature forest while the west has a doorway leading
to what appears to be a very large conference room.</pre>
