This small shrine is the most sacred room in the Justicar fortress.
The walls are built in a nearly perfect circle, and composed of
swirling black, grey and white marble. The low ceiling above is broken
by a skylight of multifaceted crystal that glows dimly no matter the
hour of the day. Beneath the skylight, lit by a thousand small shafts
of light from above, is an immense pillar. The pillar thrusts up from
the center of a gaping hole in the earth, too deep to make out the
bottom, too deep to fathom. A short outcropping of stone bridges the
chasm, allowing the monstrous pillar to be approached. Behind the
pillar on the northern wall, a heavy banner proudly displays the Seal
of the Justicars. A break in the eastern wall permits exit.</pre
