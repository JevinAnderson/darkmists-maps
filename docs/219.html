  <h1>The Altar of Sacrifice</h1>
  <pre>The trees seem to hang back in fear as you walk into a wide clearing in
the witch wood.  The clearing is dominated by a broken stone altar that
is caked red and black and the blood and grime of centuries of evil.
The torches that hang from the holes of the trees ringing the clearing
throw a halflight on a deep hole in the altar.</pre>
