    <h1 class="room-header">A Woodland Trail</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">You are following a small woodland trail in the Emerald Forest. The
hear the sound of moving water to the west, and squinting a bit
intently you see a blurred outline of a small wooden bridge in the
distance. Who built that bridge? And why? Only a few seasoned rangers
have ever come this deep into the enchanted wood, and none ever
mentioned the existence of construction of a bridge. As far as you
know, the forest has resisted gently but firmly all attempts at
colonisation or lumbering, which makes it quite a curiousity.</pre>
