  <h1>In the Keep</h1>
  <pre>You are in the main hall of the keep.  There is a pit on the ground
here, for those that have just entered to give donation to the needy.
The stone walls are blackened and pitted, and the floor is littered
with rubble from what did not remain whole during the conflagration
of immortal magic which attacked this place.
To the north appears to be a barracks of some sort, and the main hall
continues to the south.</pre>
