    <pre class="room-description">A large white marble altar sits in a prominent place in this room.  It
appears to be carved of one single piece of marble with intricate scroll
designs.  A strip of royal blue cloth runs across the length of the altar,
and upon the cloth many crosses are embroidered.  Around the room more
torches hang than through the rest of the castle.  Light sparkles in this
room and illuminates it as if you were standing under the noonday sun.
Tapestries line the walls, depicting ancient knights serving the kingdoms
of the land as all knights should.</pre>
