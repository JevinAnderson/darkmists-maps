  <h1>Within the Oasis</h1>
  <pre>You stand within the oasis with life flourishing all around. Dates and
figs hang ripe from the trees while colorful birds chirp away on the
branches. Ferns, scrub brushes, and hearty tall grass is all around you.
Evidence of humanity is everywhere. Clothes dripping from makeshift
clothing lines while baskets of woven hemp scattered here and there
filled with all manners of items. Sounds of people laughing and shouting
can be heard coming from all around. To the east and west the sides of
medium sized tents blocks your view. From here you can easily see the
source of this oasis's life, a large pond of crystal clear water.</pre>
