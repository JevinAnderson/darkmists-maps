  <h1>The Top of the Southwest Tower</h1>
  <pre>The cross winds blow you slighty about on top of the tower. From this height
all around the castle can be more than clearly viewed. A sign carved of red-
wood hangs on one of the walls. Upon another wall is a huge golden plaque
with names engraved upon it. A honeysuckle vine grows along the walls, its
leaves and flowers reaching out over just about every inch of the walls, its
roots dug into the floor beneath the plaque, a few roots reaching upward
and acting as the source of a steady flow of honeysuckle nectar which falls
into a shining golden basin. Amidst the splendor of the flowering vines are
trophies of mage heads, beneath which a great weapon hangs in honor. The
floor is covered with a thick coating of orange moss.</pre>
