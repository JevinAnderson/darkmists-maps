  <h1>Path through the shrubs</h1>
  <pre>The woodland is very thick here, yet there is a small pathway meandering
through the thick shrubs. You hear the brushing of branches and leaves
against you and feel the pressure of the woodland as you travel along
the path. To the east is what appears to be a log house big enough for
a giant to live in. A thick metallic cylinder erupts from the sturdy
wood tiled roof, and a thin continuous grey smoke rises from it. An herb
garden graces the front side of the house on either side of the doorway,
the only controlled growing done here. Everything else grows wild and
free.</pre>
