  <h1>Within the herb garden</h1>
  <pre>The smooth stone path is clear of soil and dirt, its edges tidy where the
spicy-scented herb garden meets it. Honeybees flit and buzz from bloom to
bloom, reveling in the spicy fragrances and collecting nectar. The path
extends eastward. To the west is a small, neat wooden house with an open
doorway and a woven 'welcome' mat. A shingle hanging from an iron hook in the
outer wall bears the picture of a hoe and a broom crossed at the handles.</pre>
