  <h1>A Comfortable Parlor</h1>
  <pre>In stark contrast with the rest of the mansion, this parlor seems
to be well taken care of and lavish.  Four chandeliers hang from
ceiling, blasting light in the room.  A few candles superfluously
add light to the room, which could almost blind a person, having
already suffered through the darkness in the rest of the building.
A large poster of Drehse Vs'Intey, High Arbiter of Justicar, is
pinned to the west wall, bearing numerous darts that the Syndicate
assets and allies must have thrown in their leisure time.  The
opening to the north leads back to the junction.</pre>
