    <h1 class="room-header">On a dark path</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">The hard path below you is liberally covered with soil, but clearly stone-
based. On either side of you to the east and west are thick woods. The canopy
of leaves arches over the path, lending a lovely shade but also darkening the
way. Small plants grow at the edges of the path, their leaves a light green,
their tiny flowers a pretty light violet. The buzzing of bees is audible here,
though only occasionally do you see one sipping the nectar from a tiny bloom.
Beyond those little flowering plants, there are lush green shrubs bearing
sweet berries. The path stretches to the north and south.</pre>
