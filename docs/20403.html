  <h1>Woodland practice yard</h1>
  <pre>Thick, impassable woods surround this 'practice yard' on the north,and south,
but the 'yard' extends toward the east. The 'yard' ground is hard rock
covered with soil, upon which nothing grows, for the students who practice
here keep it well tamped down. Beyond the tamped ground, however, are lush
green shrubs. A thick canopy of leaves keeps this area dark, even during day-
light hours. To the west is a path and a sign.</pre>
