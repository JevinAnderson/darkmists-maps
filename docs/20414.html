  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>The path curves here, stretching before you to the north and east. Arching
above you, the tree branches form a tunnel from their canopy of leaves.
Bushes lush with green leaves grow near the path. At the base of their
slender trunks are ground cover plants, little yellow blossoms and bright
green leaves lending a little color to the soil-strewn path.</pre>
