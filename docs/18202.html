  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The stone path meanders to the north and east here, dipping with
the land. To either side of it are tall trees, their trunks covered
with coarse bark. It is shady here, delightfully so, as a canopy of
thick leaves holds back the harshest rays of the sun during the day.
Lower to the ground, lush shrubs fill the air with freshness. A thin
stream of running water follows the path toward the east. Its origin
in the west is unseen past the thick growth of trees.</pre>
