    <h1 class="room-header">Within the gardener's house</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">A simple, low, wooden-frame bed covered with a mattress of fresh herbs and
linen cloth sits against the northern wall, its 'head' against the eastern
wall near the open doorway. A similar wooden frame, without legs, is
attached a bit higher on the walls, and a sturdy wooden ladder leads up to it.
Against the western wall, gardening tools lean. Above them, hanging on small
iron hooks, are small gardening trowels. An L-shaped table carved from
mahogany and polished to a pleasant shine seems to serve double duty as a
food table as well as a shop counter. It is against the southern wall, and
behind it, a short man with a ruddy face and a short beard sits upon a wooden
stool, eating from a bowl of food whose steam fills the little building with
a delicious aroma.</pre>
