  <h1>The Godfathers Abode</h1>
  <pre>This overlook, erected high into the upper limits of the house,
was created so the Godfather could oversee the businesses.  The
room is rather small and dim, with an iron fireplace burning
in the back of the room.  On the walls, there are a few posters
depicting wanted criminals, and a few of Lord Rellion's enemies.
In the center of the room rests a small table, surrounded by
two wooden chairs.  On the top of the table rests a few accounting
books, each with the balances of the Marauder house account penned
in them.</pre>
