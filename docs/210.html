  <h1>In Clover</h1>
  <pre>It's quite beautiful here in the quiet village of Clover.  The air is
fresh and filled with the scent of flowers.  There are some quaintly-
appointed cottages painted in bright colors on either side of the road.
You hear ringing laughter to the east, where a country path winds up a
hillock.  The village square lies to the north.</pre>
