  <h1>A Dark Hallway</h1>
  <pre>The hallway is fairly bland and the only things to see are the
everburning torches lining the walls.  It is very quiet in here,
the only sounds that can be heard are the echoes from your own
movements.  A doorway to the west leads to a room filled with
cheap looking bunks while a doorway to the east leads to room
filled with more expensive looking bunks.</pre>
