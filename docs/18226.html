  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path extends toward the north and south.
Thin trunked trees grow here, their bark smooth and grey
except where it peels from the trunk naturally. These
trees do not have a thick canopy of foliage, but their
leaves give thin, intermittant shade, allowing the sun to
filter in through the leaves during the day. The ground
is covered with a variety of ivy whose leaves measure
about five inches across. Along the east side of the
path, a stream of water gurgles northward. Along the west
side of the path is a flowerbed, neatly kept but for the
end vines of ivy which attempt to crawl over its boundaries.</pre>
