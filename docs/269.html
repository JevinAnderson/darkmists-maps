  <h1>A fairly large clearing</h1>
  <pre>There is an incredible sight before you! Dozens and dozens of
green clad pixies and oak brown dressed brownies are milling
around in a fairly large clearing, which stretches on to the east and
south. Little temporary stalls have been set up, selling a wide
variety of enchanting desserts, cream puffs and wonderful potions.
The grand Pixie-Brownie Bonanza Festival seems up in force, and
there are no signs of it ending in the near future...</pre>
