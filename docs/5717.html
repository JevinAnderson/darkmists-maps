  <h1>A moderate Crusader barracks</h1>
  <pre>You enter a barracks built for the medium and smaller races in the Crusader
ranks. Comfortable cots and bunks with heavy cotton blankets line the walls.
Several nests made of straw and twigs line the northern part of the walls for
the draconian race to sleep in. A fireplace to the east burns various pine
woods, warming the room and carrying the fresh scent of pine in the air.</pre>
