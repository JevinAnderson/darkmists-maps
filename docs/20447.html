    <pre class="room-description">The trees have given way to a clearing, hidden from the main walkway in the
city, hidden from the southern viewpoint overlooking the roaring waterfall.
From here you can see that waterfall to the south and down, a breathtaking
sight within the east-west river below. The spray from the nearby waterfall
occasionally blows up toward you, cooling your face and sprinkling the roses
here with fresh water. These miniature, deep blue roses grow on what appear
to be miniature trees. Their thorns are likewise tiny, though still sharp.
By the trees shielding them from the harsh afternoon sun is a simple struc-
ture of living wood, formed of the trees themselves, roofed by a canopy of
leaves.</pre>
