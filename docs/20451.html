    <h1 class="room-header">Dark, enclosed path</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">The path here is darker than any of the surrounding environs. Trees, gnarled
and skeletal, encroach on the path, inspiring feelings of claustrophobia, and
thoughts that a branch might of its own will reach out and grab you. To the
north is a clearing where these trees give way to a small, broken tower. The
rock wall facing you is smashed, so that you can look through it and see a
large throne made entirely of skulls located in the center of the floor of
the tower. There is not a doorway to enter by, so much as a large smashed-in
section of the wall through which a giant could pass.</pre>
