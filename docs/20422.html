    <h1 class="room-header">A woody alcove</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">You are surrounded from north, east, and west by thick woodland, tall trees
and lush green bushes. The trees have formed a natural canopy high above you,
blocking much of the sunlight. At the edges of the stone-hard, soil-strewn
path are low growing flowering plants with bright green leaves and tiny blos-
soms of light blue and burnished gold. A sweet fragrance fills the air here,
and the sound of buzzing alerts you to the presence of honey bees. Once in a
while you see one sipping nectar from the human thumbnail-sized flowers. To
the west, the trees appear to have grown together in a curious fashion, as
if forming a dwelling of some sort. An opening between trunks is large
enough for a giant to pass through.</pre>
