  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path extends to the east and west. Lit by naturally glowing lichen
which cling to the striated walls, it seems to stretch far in either direc-
tion. High above, the ceiling is dark. Faint sounds can be heard to echo, but
they are not discernible.</pre>
