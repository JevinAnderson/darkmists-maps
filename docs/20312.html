  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path extends north, east, and west here, the T-section lit by
clumps of naturally glowing lichen which cling to the walls and ceiling.
Northward the passage is straight, likewise westward. To the east the path
takes a turn and seems to have a different hue of light.</pre>
