  <h1>The Room of Preparation</h1>
  <pre>In many ways this room looks like the rest of the castle, blue hues
decorate the floors and walls.  Torches hang on the wall giving off
enough light to see by easily.  This room however is setup to help
train young squires and even the knights in their continued training.
Racks of weapons sit along the wall, and a knight stands in the room
ready to spar with all who wish to learn.  A cot sits along the wall
to give those training a comfortable place to rest.</pre>
