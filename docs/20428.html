  <h1>By the pond and herb garden</h1>
  <pre>Curving toward the north and east, the hard soil-strewn path makes its way by
a clear, crystalline blue pond. The surface waters are mostly still, but
occasionally you notice a little movement just below the surface, and you can
make out some silvery fish swimming. Water herbs grow along the edge of the
pond. Along the path, the grass is green and healthy, except at the western
edge of the path, where a hole, measuring about two human foot-lengths in
diameter and lined with dark stone, rises like a well. But this is no water
well. From the depths, smoke rises, carrying with it interesting scents of
burning wood, cooking pastries, and roasting meat. Beyond this smoke well is
an herb garden. The path branches to the south through the garden on one side
and unhindered woodland on the other.</pre>
