  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path leads to the west toward a turn southward, but otherwise to
the north and east to alcoves in the expertly hewn and smooth striated stone.
Lichen clinging to the walls and ceiling lend light to the passage. You hear
the sounds of activity to the north and east. A vaulted opening leads to the
north, from which a great heat emerges. Another vaulted opening leads to an
alcove to the east.  At the arch is a wooden sign.</pre>
