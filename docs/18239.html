  <h1>The end of the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path extends to the north from here,
leading toward a path encircling a miniature forest
garden of deciduous trees amid grasses and moss. To
the east and south are well-kept flowerbeds. A bench
is here for resting and enjoying the view of the
miniature garden to the northnorth-west. To the west,
a few fern trees grow, surrounded by small bushes
with tiny, brilliant red roses blooming within thorny
cages.</pre>
