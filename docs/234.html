  <h1>The Woodkeepers' Outpost</h1>
  <pre>Your fellow rangers hail you as you stride into this wide clearing.
Some are preparing to leave on their daily treks through the forest,
while others are tending to injured woodland animals.  The Guildmaster's
cabin lies to the north, while several smaller cabins lie to the south.
A fair-sized lodge sits beneath a Redwood tree to your east.</pre>
