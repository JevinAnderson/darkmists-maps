  <h1>Heavy Vertigo's End</h1>
  <pre>The sense of vertigo is even heavier than the previous 'level',leaving you
in a bewildered and disoritented state. Floating in this space, what you see
borders on indescribable.  The walls and floor of this strange place are in
constant flux, spinning and oscillating wildly and making your head spin. You
wonder if you can even gain footing in here to make your way forward. The walls
crackle intensely with psionic energy and seem to register your unwelcome
presence with hostility.  You feel your mind exerting a constant effort just to
keep a strange presence from turning your brain to scrambled eggs. You feel
exhausted from the effort, yet the flow of mana coursing its way through your
body also seems to be increased.  The smell of rotting things and old mildew
is heavy in the air here, and every once in a while,  a strange breeze flows
through this "tunnel". Or did you imagine that breeze? In fact, you're not
quite sure if you can trust yoursenses in this  place with any reliability
at all. The only directions you can stumble toward are back to the south, or
through a crackling portal here.</pre>
