  <h1>Along a path of polished stone</h1>
  <pre>The stone beneath you is polished to a perfect shine, with few or no
imperfections. It is wide here, wide enough to enjoy a picnic or lie
down and stare up at the stars at night beyond the canopy of leaves
up above, a canopy which has opened up above the clear blue spring to
the east. The path extends northward, where it narrows a little. To
the south is an impassable wall of rock extending upward. You hear
the sound of water falling, both above you, and to the north. If
you are careful, you can enter the spring to the east. To the west
is an opening in the rock, leading to a cavern.</pre>
