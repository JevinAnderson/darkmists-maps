    <pre class="room-description">This corner of the Justicar stronghold contains a small battleground,
an arena designed to allow the lawmen to practice and duel to hone
their skills. The marble floor stops suddenly, dropping down into a
pit perhaps thirty feet across and four deep. Decorative weapons hang
on the southern and eastern walls, though nicks along their blades
indicate that the weapons were not always purely ornamental. The
bottom of the pit has been filled with a coarse white sand, clumped
here and there with dried blood- the training that takes place here
must be serious indeed. A pile of limp-looking practice dummies rests
in the southeast corner, and bits of cloth that used to be practice
dummies lie partially buried under the sand. The stronghold continues
to a dim room northward, and west to a large stairwell.</pre>
