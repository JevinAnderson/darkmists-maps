  <h1>A peaceful rock pool</h1>
  <pre>You've entered a very peaceful part of the mystic's home. A crystal clear
pool sits here with large smooth pebbles neatly arranged all around its
circumference. Peering into the pool, the unmoving mirror like surface of
the water reflect your image. There is no way of knowing exactly how deep
the pool is, but it must be very deep since you can't see the bottom. There
is a small wooden bench here beckoning you to sit and rest for a while,
and ponder things you've put aside, and think on matters you've forgotten.</pre>
