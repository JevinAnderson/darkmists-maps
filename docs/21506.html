  <h1>Common Room: Circle of Night</h1>
  <pre>Entering this common room, you get the distinct feeling that you might not
want to remain here.  The room is unbearably hot and stuffy.  On the southern
wall where you might suspect windows to be, there are thick velvet curtains.
A fire in the fireplace set in the northern wall provides lacklustre light
through the room, and makes it all the more eerie from the shadows it
produces.  You can make out a couch, and some tables, but the finer detail is
lost in the shadow.  Small candles have been placed on some of the tables, in
case the occupants wished light to study by.</pre>
