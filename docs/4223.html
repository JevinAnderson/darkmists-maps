  <h1>Under a Burning Archway</h1>
  <pre>You are beneath a wide tunnel carved deep into the scorched earth. The arched
ceiling is well over twenty feet above your head, yet the heat of the flames
is already causing you to break a heavy sweat. Judging by the look of things
the burning arch is nearly ten feet wide, and it's unclear just how the fire
continues to burn without any sort of obvious fuel.  It must be some source
of infernal power.  The swarms of insects seem to avoid these archways, as
their thick and lacquered carapaces cannot withstand the intense heat of
the hellfire. You feel the urge to move quickly lest the ever burning arch
of infernal flames surges out to incinerate you.</pre>
