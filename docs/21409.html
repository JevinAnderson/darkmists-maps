  <h1>The Inner Sanctuary</h1>
  <pre>The first thing that catches your eye in this room is the round, sunken
ceremonial crypt. Serpent-coiled jasper columns surround the burial pit
next to an agate dome embedded all over with human skulls, animal bones
and fossilized excrement. Your eyes then notice that opposite of you,
across the circular crypt, is a large obsidian throne inlaid with numerous
gemstones. Brazen censers are suspended on iron chains, leaking vapours
that drool upon the floor and crawl like larvae to the alabaster base of
the hideous statue. The blood rains down from above, coating any and every
single thing in the room. Time moves here, slowly seeping into the future.</pre>
