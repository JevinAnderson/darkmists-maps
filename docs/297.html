  <h1>Inside the mountain</h1>
  <pre>You walk into a large enclosure with words of many languages carved into
the walls.  A motley assortment of rugs is splayed haphazardly on the
floor.  Rusted pots with oak saplings sit on the rugs.  Mismatched
furnitures line the walls.  The sound of crackling fire comes from the
west through an iron door that is slightly ajar.
Someone with bad taste obviously lives here.</pre>
