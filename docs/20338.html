  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path stretches from east to west. The walls of striated rock to the
north and south are covered with a glowing lichen whose light comes naturally
and brightens the passageway. The ceiling is high and dark, and you can hear
low echoing sounds from a distance.</pre>
