  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path extends east and west upon uneven ground
that slopes downward toward the west, upward toward the east.
To the south, a field of dark green ivy covers the ground, its
leaves measuring about five inches across. Within the field of
ivy, thin trunked trees rise up, their smooth grey bark peeling
in places. Intermittant shade covers this area, as the trees do
not have thick, large leaves. On the northern side of the path,
a neatly kept flowerbed fends off the adventurous vines of ivy
which seek to climb over its boundaries.</pre>
