  <h1>Corridor</h1>
  <pre>The floor of this room is a little more than packed dirt beneath
one's feet. Loose pieces of gravel and dirt look as if they
could still be scattered about by a sliding foot. Light can be
seen coming from within a rather large doorway. A low murmur of
voices and other jovial sounds can be heard from within. Torches
are constantly burning in their golden sconces upon the walls.</pre>
