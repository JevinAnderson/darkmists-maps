  <h1>The Fortress Ward</h1>
  <pre>The fortress ward is actually within the mountain itself, hollowed
out by unknown means.  It is a massive chamber designed as a
rally point for defending or in preparation for attacking.  To
the north is an entrance to go deeper into the mountain fortress.
To the east is the Covenant bestiary.</pre>
