  <h1>Pasture</h1>
  <pre>Through the enlightened methods of irrigation, the Lord of the
Manor was able to turn this edge of the desert into a lush pasture
for the use of his cattle and sheep. To the north is the path
through the Manor. The pasture extends south and west. To the east
is a small house, its door hanging open.</pre>
