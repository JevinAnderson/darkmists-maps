  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The smooth striation of rock to your north and south is lit by the naturally
glowing lichen growing in clumps on the walls and ceiling. The only way to
travel here is to the east or west. To the east the tunnel opens up, and to
the west the tunnel continues its narrow way.</pre>
