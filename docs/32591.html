  <h1>A Strange Alcove</h1>
  <pre>This earthy tunnel is damp and smells like spring rains. A celestial light
shines from above, searing your eyes which have become so accustomed to
the darkness.  You can make out some large antechambers hollowed out in the
walls here as if someone hastily was looking to conceal something.
The markings on the antechamber walls draw your attention.</pre>
