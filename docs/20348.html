  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>Northward and southward the stony path stretches, bordered on east and west
by striated rock to which clings a naturally glowing lichen. The ceiling is
high and dark. Looking southward, you see a number of stone columns, shaped
as an hourglass, if one were made of a knit fabric and stretched from top to
bottom.</pre>
