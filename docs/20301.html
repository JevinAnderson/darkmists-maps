  <h1>Path sloping downward</h1>
  <pre>The forest path slopes downward toward the west, and the trees seem to gain
in height and in girth. The path is hard packed, and above, a canopy of
leaves stretches overhead, forming a natural tunnel. The happy chirping of
birds reaches your ears. Looking toward the west you see something dark and
striped. Toward the east is more forest land, though the trees are smaller.</pre>
