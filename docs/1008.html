    <pre class="room-description">Dark energy flows through this place, a feeling that permeates your
entire form. You feel it, physically - it grows as you stand within,
escalating almost to the point of pain. A deep channel flows through
the center of this long, endless room. It extends endlessly, eternally,
flowing with a small stream of thick black liquid. The liquid
appears scummy, an oily film floating on the surface of the liquid.
The chamber is open, huge; the floor is far below the surface of the
land, and the room is expansive. There are no divisions in the Ahzra
In'trea, the chamber is whole, though dark. No light sources are
visible in the room, yet an eerie white glow sneaks through the
darkness. The chamber is almost foggy, thick strands of gossamer
spanning the entire ceiling of the chamber. The silky strands move,
propelled by some unseen force. They are silhouetted white against the
darkness, few can be seen, but they are certainly there. Images appear
and fade, indescribable, without comprehension - yet their presence
is clear. To the south, twin pentagrams burn through the air, flanking
a swirling, crackling mass of demonic energy.</pre>
