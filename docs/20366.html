    <pre class="room-description">You can see bits of gravel and dust on the ground by grace of the softly
glowing lichen which clings, in red and gold streaks, to the striated walls.
The high ceiling looms darkly above, unseen through the gloom. In the center
of this quiet place is a block of stone. It resembles granite, and is smooth
to the touch. In bas-relief, on each side, is the form of a muscular centaur
wearing a crown. Upon the stone block is a candelabra in the shape of a
horseshoe holding nine candles, each burning at a different rate.  To the
side of the horseshoe candelabra is an iron crown. A vaulted archway to the
east, almost resembling a horseshoe, leads out to the tunnel. On closer
examination, where the 'holes' would be for 'nails' to attach the 'horseshoe',
you see small bas-relief crowns.</pre>
