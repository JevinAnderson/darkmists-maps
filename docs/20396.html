  <h1>On a path</h1>
  <pre>The rock-hard path here leads east and west. Strewn with soil, it shows signs
of returning to the woodland bordering it on the north and south. Small plants
with brave leaves attempt to grow on the path, risking being stomped down. The
woodland north and south grows fearlessly, untouched by civilization. All
around you is the sweet scent of green growth.</pre>
