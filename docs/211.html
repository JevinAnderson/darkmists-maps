  <h1>A Green Hillock</h1>
  <pre>You are on a small meadow on the hillock.  This seems to be where the
folk of Clover have their picnics.  From the sound of manly crooning
accompanied by girlish titters, you deduce it also where the local lasses
receive the attentions of their suitors.  Scattered trees and trimmed
hedges provide the green with shadynooks and pivate arbors.  The
hillock continues north, while the path west will take you back to the
village.</pre>
