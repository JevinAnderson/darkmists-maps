  <h1>The Merchant's Lair</h1>
  <pre>This small alcove houses several wooden shelves filled with random
items.  The reddish-brown limestone walls connect with the cleft
passage northwards.  The sediment accumulated on the floor of this
chamber is littered with fossilized bat droppings and animal remains.
The ceiling lined with needle-like crystals sags slightly due to the
stress caused by the downward incline of the entire cavern, making
this alcove a precarious spot for those who linger.
An agitated thrall merchant stands behind a small cabinet.</pre>
