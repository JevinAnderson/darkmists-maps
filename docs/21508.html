  <h1>Rotunda</h1>
  <pre>The walls of this circular room are covered in paintings.  The paintings seem
to be depictions of former ArchMages of Arcana, and some that you recognize from
the Conclave.  You see names that are now legends, and others that are more
obscure. A beautiful red carpet takes up the entire room, and you almost sink
into its comfortable texture.  As you continue looking at the paintings, which
almost have a life of their own, you suddenly notice two large exits from the
room which you would swear weren't there a moment ago.  In the eastern wall, a
glowing archway is set into the wall, and you can feel the sheer, raw power
from that direction. In the northern wall is a set of double doors that are
closed and covered with runes. To the south is a large alcove, set off from
the rest of the room. Three intertwining columns composed of blue, white and
black energies support a semi-translucent spiral stairway leading upwards.</pre>
