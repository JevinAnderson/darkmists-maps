  <h1>A Dark Hallway</h1>
  <pre>The hallway is fairly bland and the only things to see are the
everburning torches lining the walls.  It is very quiet in here,
the only sounds that can be heard are the echoes from your own
movements.  To the east is a doorway leading to what appears to
be a dungeon, and to the west is a room that is filled with
interrogation instruments.</pre>
