  <h1>In the Emerald Forest</h1>
  <pre>A circle of blue-capped mushrooms form an old faerie ring by the side
of the path you are on.  On certain nights of the year, the faerie folk
wander out into such rings for wild dances by the moonlight.  It is
said that mortals who are drawn into the dancing circle on such nights
can be held captive by faerie food or a faerie's kiss and made to dance
on and on for a period of seven years.  You hear a titter of laughter
from the branches of a tree, but when you look up you see nothing.</pre>
