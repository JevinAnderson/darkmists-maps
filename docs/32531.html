  <h1>At the Verge of Mental Implosion</h1>
  <pre>It takes all of your might and a small miracle to fixate on the crackling
portal of energy in the center of this room.  Your senses are going haywire
and your brain feels like it is throbbing and hemmorhaging all at once. Your
senses have long ago stopped responding to normal stimulation, and you wonder
if maybe you should just give up and succumb to the mental pressures here, or
if you dare continue through the portal to the next layer of complete mental
anguish.</pre>
