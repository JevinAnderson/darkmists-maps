  <h1>Outside the entrance to a cave</h1>
  <pre>The limestone archway is twelve feet across and ten feet high with a
faintly perceptible passage leading inwards.  From a side glance, the
stone formation appears to be a domelike structure; the top portion
slants downwards, sinking heavily into the earth, instead of continuing
straight further down the back.  A thick cloud of rubble, dirt, sand,
and plant debris partly conceals the narrow aperture of this rockpile,
an entrance to the subterranean depths within. The cold, damp air
originating from inside the structure is seemingly inviting and a
comforting means of escape from the excessively dry and humid
surroundings of the expanse northwards.  A stone 'monolith' formed
from lava rock with 'writing' upon it stands near the passageway.</pre>
