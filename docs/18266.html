  <h1>The Trebuchet Above the Lechium Cavern</h1>
  <pre>Looking about the tower, you realize that you are
standing within a huge trebuchet. The entire tower is
surrounded by huge redwood trees which block your view
of the surrounding forest. Standing where you are, it
seems as if you only need utter the word "Release", and
you would be flung halfway across Thera!</pre>
