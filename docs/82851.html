  <h1>Entrance to the compound</h1>
  <pre>The thick wall that surrounds the compound is broken by a large gate here. The
double doors of the gate are reinforced by thick bands of mithril, and they
stand open. What can be seen of the inside of the compound is stone and
marble, hallways stretching into darkness beyond.</pre>
