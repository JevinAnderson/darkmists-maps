  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>To the west is a vaulted archway, vaguely reminiscent of a horseshoe, beyond
which is a quiet alcove. Peering through the archway, you see a dark block of
stone, upon which are nine candles, each lit. The stony path twists here,
leading southward along a twisty way, and eastward for a straight run. Lichen
clinging to the walls here glow with a natural soft light, brightening the way.
High above, the ceiling is dark, as is the floor below you.</pre>
