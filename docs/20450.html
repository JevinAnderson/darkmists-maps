    <pre class="room-description">Within the thick, wild-grown trees is a small clearing. Carpet grass covers
the ground, blades thickly close together, giving one a sense of lightness
while walking upon it. In the center of this clearing is a throne formed, as
it appears, from granite. Its shape is simple, a block of stone with solid
stone armrests and a solid stone backrest standing straight up, formed with
attentiveness in mind, not comfort. Upon the top of the austere backrest is
a curiosity: The backrest itself is a slab of five sides, the top side rising
to a point as in a shape of a house that a child might draw. At the top point,
however, is a granite globe, balancing upon it. Along the edge of the throne
are runic letters.</pre>
