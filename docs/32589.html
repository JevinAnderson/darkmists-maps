  <h1>Ascending out of the Darkness</h1>
  <pre>The crackling and shimmering portal remains open behind you, but your desire
to go back is plagued by painful memories of mental anguish. This earthy
tunnel is damp and smells like spring rains. A celestial light shines from
above, searing your eyes which have become so accustomed to darkness.</pre>
