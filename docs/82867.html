  <h1>The compound supply room</h1>
  <pre>The supply room is a necessity, and thus is decorated sparsely. The stone
walls are bereft of any tapestries, and the marble floor seems scuffed and not
as highly polished as the rest of the compound.  A wooden counter sits at the
western end of the room.</pre>
