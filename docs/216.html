  <h1>Farmer Griff's Farm</h1>
  <pre>You stand in front of a gaily-painted barnhouse.  Old Griff - farmer,
freeman and entrepreneur - seems to be having a little trouble keeping
his livestock in order.  His chickens are harrying his ducks in the
duck pond, while a big brown shaggy dog is chasing his pigs around the
entire farm.  From inside a blue and yellow farmhouse you hear Princess
Yaruga, the farmer's wife, shouting angrily in a foreign tongue.</pre>
