  <h1>The Final Test</h1>
  <pre>The surge of power coming from above is palpable here.  There is nothing else
worthy of your attention as you float your way up toward the source of this
unseen power.  Large glass tubes containing submerged slimy looking mauve
hivespawn react ominously at your presence, thumping and flopping uncomfortably
against their glass prisons.  A strange assortment of ethereal cords, synapses,
neurons and other brain-matter connect the tubes with a glowing source from
above. A humming and crackling psionic barricade prevents further ascension,
and you would be wise not to approach it without the necessary clearance.</pre>
