  <h1>The end of a hallway within the compound</h1>
  <pre>The hallway ends abruptly here. The stone walls seem to press down upon you,
and there is no way to go but to the east. A tapestry covers the west wall, a
weaving depicting the capture of a black dragon. The polished marble floor
reflects the light of the suspended globes, and sounds echo through the air.</pre>
