  <h1>Intelligence Office</h1>
  <pre>Maps, hastily scribbled notes, diagrams, and sketches of various people
and monsters are scattered all over the walls and even the ceiling of this
room.  Covert Operatives run around comparing notes and sending runners to
the officers, making this place quite noisy.  The room is lit with a couple
of glowcrystal lamps, making it fairly well lit.</pre>
