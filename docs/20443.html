  <h1>Within the herb garden</h1>
  <pre>The smooth stone path here is well swept, free of pebbles or bits of soil. It
extends eastward and westward through a spicy herb garden. Along the north
and south edges of the path, you can tell that a gardener has kept the small
plant growth from extending beyond the garden. Within the garden itself,
herbs thrive, their spicy blooms attracting numerous buzzing honeybees.</pre>
