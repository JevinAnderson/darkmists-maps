  <h1>Near the Summit</h1>
  <pre>It has become almost unbearably cold as you trek near the very summit
of the mountain.  The bare and broken trees provide no cover for you as
a cold and gusty wind whips the falling snow harshly into your face.
A pine forest covers the slopes of the mountain, while to your south
you spot a narrow mountain pass.</pre>
