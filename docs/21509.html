  <h1>Office of The Master of the Tower</h1>
  <pre>Resplendent.  That is all that can describe this room, and not even that can
offer a modicum of the wonder that it is.  Bookshelves line the walls of this
circular room.  They are filled to the point of being overstuffed with
manuals, grimoires, tomes, books, codexes, scrolls and any other form of
printed word imaginable.  Each one has a resonance all its own, each one
beckons you to read its secrets.  As if that were not enough to keep a mortal
magus busy for a lifetime, small podiums and cabinets interspace the book-
shelves at points, and hold some of the most powerful and legendary magical
items that you have ever heard of.  Collected over the years by the Lord of
Magic and former Tower Masters, these relics are kept here for safekeeping.
Each one has an eternity of stories to tell.  A large desk, made from an
enormous granite slab sits at the northern end of the room, right in front of
a large glass window that looks over the whole of the Theran landscape.  In
front of the desk stand two chairs, to welcome those who would speak with the
Master of the Hourglass Tower.</pre>
