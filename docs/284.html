  <h1>South-easterly end of the forest</h1>
  <pre>You stand at the southern most end of the Emerald Forest. The path
continues on north, while to the west appears to be a large clearing
with sounds of laughter and conversation drifting in with the breeze.
There is a sheer drop to the south, while mountains stretch on as far
as your eyes can see. The terrain belows seems mostly rock and stone
and has spare vegetation. You can just make out a small path heading
roughly to the east through a cluster of bushes and trees.</pre>
