  <h1>The Ancient Library</h1>
  <pre>Piles of ancient tomes are scattered about this room. With a closer
look, they all appear to be transparent, as if the books themselves
were ghosts.  Though you may not be able to touch the books, the titles
send chills down your spine.  Many of the books before you are long lost
wizard tomes, as well as legendary rites that describe how to summon
demons of all sorts.  The librarian, an undead being herself, smiles
gently as she closes one of the ghostly tomes and looks up at you.
Without a word, she points to a sign on the wall.</pre>
