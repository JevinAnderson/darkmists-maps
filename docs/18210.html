  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path forms a T here, the crosspiece of it
stretched east and west, and the stem extending far to the
south. To the north are huge redwood trees, their trunks as
wide around as about nine giants in a huddle together. A
couple small plants have started growing among the redwoods.
The canopy of leaves high above offers shade.</pre>
