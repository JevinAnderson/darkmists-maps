  <h1>Hall</h1>
  <pre>The great house is richly furnished with the finery the Lord
collected during his youth as a Crusader. To the north is a
study, to the south a dining room, and to the east a bedroom.
Westward is the entrance to the great house. Near one of the
arched entranceways is a small plaque.</pre>
