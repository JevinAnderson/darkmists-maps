  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>Lit by naturally glowing lichen clinging to the striated walls, the stony
path stretches to the north and south here. High above you is a dark ceiling,
as below you a dark floor where the lichen dare not grow. Faint echoes of
noises bounce around, but are not discernible as to what exactly causes them.</pre>
