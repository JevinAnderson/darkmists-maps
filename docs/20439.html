  <h1>Within the herb garden</h1>
  <pre>The smooth stone path is lined with herbs, and the herbs stretch out beyond
in a neat garden. The edges of the path are kept clean and tidy. Not much in
the way of dirt and soil is scattered upon this part of the path. The clean
path extends eastward and westward. Toward the west you see a neat looking
wooden structure with an open doorway.</pre>
