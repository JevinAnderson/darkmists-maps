  <h1>Inside the cabin</h1>
  <pre>Kevinlape's large log cabin affords him a comfortable place to sleep.
The huge bedframe is made from zebrawood, one of the strongest woods
in the world. This structure stands along the eastern wall, and is
covered with an assortment of fur blankets. Elsewhere in the room you
see a few chairs and a table.</pre>
