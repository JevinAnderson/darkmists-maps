  <h1>A Forest Trail</h1>
  <pre>The somewhat ragged west-ward forest trail makes a sharp right and
southernly turn here, making further travel to the west difficult
if not impossible, would be safer to backtrack and find another
path instead of hacking through the notoriously resilient trees of the
Emerald Forest. A tall tree with huge leafy branches branches stands
here tempting you to take a break and rest in its shade.</pre>
