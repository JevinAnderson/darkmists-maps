  <h1>A Signpost in the Enchanted Forests</h1>
  <pre>Through the majestic oaks of these ancient woods, the deep earthiness of
the forest permeates your senses, while a gentle hum of magic in the air
pulses low and vibrant.  A shy nymph peeks inquisitively at you from
behind a tree before disappearing with a titter.  An old but sturdy
signpost stands beside a crossing in the paths, which lead in every
direction.</pre>
