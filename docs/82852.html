  <h1>Within the compound</h1>
  <pre>The compound stretches out before you, a featureless mass of stone and marble.
The floor is polished to a shine, reflecting the light from the glowing globes
that hang suspended, seemingly magically, in the air. To the north and south,
the featureless stone walls can be seen, and any sound made is amplified by
the polished marble floor. A hallway extends to the west.
Hanging on the south wall is a framed parchment entitled, TREATY.</pre>
