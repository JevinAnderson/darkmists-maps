  <h1>On a path</h1>
  <pre>This path leads toward a stone bridge over a river to the south. To
the north is an archway which appears to be an entry into an area
currently being worked on by gardeners and construction workers.
The gardeners are planting trees, and the construction workers are
fashioning either a bridge over a pond, or tables with benches.
Far to the north beyond the pond, a small cabin is being built. The
area is surrounded by walls formed of thick logs.</pre>
