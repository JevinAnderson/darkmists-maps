    <h1>The Gates of Castle Balkra</h1>
    <pre>
A stone road leads to the massive structure of Castle Balkra. The gigantic
iron gates which lock the outer keep are swung wide open.  The hardened stone
walls of the castle loom about three to four stories. Battle runes and mottos
are inscribed within the front stone walls. From this spot four large towers
can be seen jutting out of the four corners of the castle.  On each tower a
Crusader banner whips in the winds. The stone blocks forming the thick
structure of the outer castle gleam white in either sunlight or moonlight. If
you're an intruder your awakening is a rude one if the Samurai guardian is
present to deliver a devastating assault.</pre
