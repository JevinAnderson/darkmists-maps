  <h1>Along a path of polished stone</h1>
  <pre>The stone beneath you is polished almost to a perfect shine. There
are few imperfections in the stone here. A sheer cliff of craggy
rock rises upward to the east of you, and to the west is a modest
body of clear blue water. The loud sound of falling water comes
from the north, where you see it landing into the large spring
from a height about halfway up the rock face. As your eyes follow
the waterfall upward, you see that there is a second waterfall:
Directly to the west across the spring is another sheer cliff, and
about two-thirds up, a waterfall rushes to a ledge, where the water
seems to gather and rush along to the north and then falls rapidly
down into the spring. Some overflow streams downward along that
western cliff face as the water makes its way northward toward the
final fall.</pre>
