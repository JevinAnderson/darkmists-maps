    <h1 class="room-header">A Break in the Webs - the Spiked</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">The strands of gossamer grow thick here, the sticky webs clinging
to your face and body as you venture through this dim chamber. It
reeks of death, of sulfur - it leaves a bitter taste upon your tongue.
Through the thick webs, a clearing emerges. It is spherical in shape,
the web a physical boundary around the outside. Only one path is open
to your travel, as the floor is rudely interrupted by rows upon rows
of jagged spikes. Their heights are uniform, the only interruption
in their shape is the occasional heap of bones. Tatters of cloth
lay in some areas, still adorning their dead owners. The path leads
forward, into a circle void of spikes. The circle is ringed by a
strange roofless structure of black iron, contrasting deeply against
the white spidersilk threads. The iron is thin, rusted and bent into
containing bars. They are not wide enough to stop a mortal's exit,
but once, perhaps, it was used to contain another sort of beast.
Outside of the circle, a bed of spikes has been fashioned from broken
and jagged shards, floating a few inches above the actual circle.
Spots of blood adorn the tips of every spike, the remnants of those
who dared to rest upon it. The only exit from this Dead Grotto is to
your east, the path from which you entered.</pre>
