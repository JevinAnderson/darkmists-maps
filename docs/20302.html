  <h1>Path between pillars</h1>
  <pre>The forest path slopes downward toward the east, upward toward the west. Here
the trees are very thick, both in girth and proximity. Overhead a thick
canopy of leaves forms a natural tunnel. The chirping of birds is audible. To
the west is a stone structure, perhaps a huge monolith as never seen in Thera
anywhere else. Hewn into it is a passage large enough to admit the largest of
giants, yet the stone rises well above the ceiling point. The stone is
striated brown and grey. To the east, the path slopes upward toward more
forest.</pre>
