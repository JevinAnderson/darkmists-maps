  <h1>Base of the grand stairwell</h1>
  <pre>A wide spiral staircase stands at the southern end of the stronghold's
first floor, leading upstairs to a quieter portion of the Justicar
fortress. The steps of broad marble are lined down the center with a
thick, rich carpeting of deep blue. The thousands footfalls these steps
bear are heavy with both weight and with responsibility. A wide tapestry
is hung along the inner wall of the stairwell, and a tall painting stands
opposite. A gleaming railing of brass follows the outside of the circular
stairwell as it ascends towards a bright room above. A wide, shallow pit
yawns open in the floor eastward while to the west, you can see massive
shelves of supplies. A grand courtyard opens up to the north while to the
south, you may exit into a wooded area.</pre>
