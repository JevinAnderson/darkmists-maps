  <h1>Large Alcove</h1>
  <pre>This room is dedicated to the Lady Xyza, and is a place where members of the
Conclave come to commune, receive healing, and to donate items for use by
other members.  This place has an extreme aura of peace and divinity.  The
southern wall holds an immaculate statue of the Mistress of Magic, who looks
upon those who serve her cause with eyes of mercy and hope.</pre>
