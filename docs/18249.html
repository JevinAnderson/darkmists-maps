  <h1>Behind the waterfall</h1>
  <pre>The stone beneath you is polished almost to a perfect shine. Above you,
the rock wall has formed an overhanging ceiling. A waterfall forms a very
wet wall to the south, occasionally spraying water upon you where you
stand. Remaining on the path will prevent a slip and a fall to the rocks
below, where the waterfall plunges. To the north is an opening in the rock
wall, leading perhaps into a cavern. The path of polished stone extends to
the east and west.</pre>
