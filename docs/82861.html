  <h1>The compound armory</h1>
  <pre>The armory of the compound is made of the same stone and polished marble as
the rest of the building. Lining the walls are weapon racks, with an
assortment of various weapons, from pikes to swords to daggers. Armor stands
hold an equally varied selection of armor, whether plate, scale or leather.
Glowing balls of light hang in the air, and they are reflected by the polished
marble floor.</pre>
