  <h1>On the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path encircling the deep pool to the west
slopes downward to the north and upward to the south. On the
eastward side, tall trees rise up, their canopy of leaves
lending shade upon the path but none upon the water below.
Across the way, to the west, you can see a stone bridge over
a modest waterfall. Green, leafy shrubs grow between the
tree trunks, their branches reaching out toward you.</pre>
