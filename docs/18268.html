  <h1>The Massive Cavern of the Lady of Purity</h1>
  <pre>The walls of the cavern here are adorned with silver sconces
and dark blue candles kept burning. Between the sconces are
parchments framed with polished wood. You see a number of
such parchments, each one numbered and worded in Common. The
floor is covered with a number of throw rugs made from the
pelts of large beasts. The pelts are soft to the touch and
clean, somehow, despite the fact that people walk through
here with their outdoor boots on.</pre>
