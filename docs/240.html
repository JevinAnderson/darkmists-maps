  <h1>The Lost Grotto</h1>
  <pre>You follow the stream to a limpid pool where the waters lap gently
against the rocks.  Large ferns provide shade from above and the petals
of brightly-colored flowers float in the pool.  Sitting on the moss-
covered rocks by the pool is a slim young girl dressed in green.  She
has long black hair and elfin features, a yew bow slung across her back.
She seems oblivious to your presence and hums softly as she passes her
hand through the waters.</pre>
