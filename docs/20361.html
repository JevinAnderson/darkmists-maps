  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path extends north and south. From the north you hear the sounds of
activity. The eastern and western walls are of striated rock, to which cling
some naturally glowing lichen which graciously lend light to the passage.
Below you, and high above, the floor and ceiling are dark.</pre>
