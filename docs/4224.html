  <h1>A Dark Tunnel</h1>
  <pre>This tunnel is surprisingly nondescript and apparently not often used based
on the lack of evidence of foot traffic. A single torch hangs in an iron
sconce on the wall, but given the lack of oxygen available, all that is
visible is a dim blue flame that casts off almost no light at all. With
little else to look at here, you can return back to the archway and risk
a dance with flames, or toward a secluded large cave to the south.</pre>
