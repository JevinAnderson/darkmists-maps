  <h1>A Woody Copse</h1>
  <pre>You've stumbled into a small woody copse.  The trees here have grown
close and their curtains of vines obscure the view in any direction.
The fresh scent of wild thicket flowers hang in the air, the source of
which cannot be found.  A small green carpet lies in the middle of a
clearing, leading you to believe you've happened across someone's
quiet time area.</pre>
