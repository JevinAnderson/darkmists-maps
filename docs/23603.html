  <h1>Apothecary</h1>
  <pre>The western wall of this room is filled with long wooden shelves. They
are filled with hundreds of different concoctions and poultices contained
in jars of every shape, size and color. Despite the prolific number of
containers that fill the shelves, they are remarkably neat, with each jar
carefully labelled and facing forward for easy access. Each of the
mixtures looks meant to aid the healing arts in some way. A door leads
back out to the east into the massive foyer.</pre>
