  <h1>The Altar of the Never Ending Crusades</h1>
  <pre>A simplistic granite block rests in the middle of the room here.  In
this block is housed the sacred War Gauntlet.  Only the Wise One is
allowed to touch its surface without divine retribution.  This room
of the Keep was also left unscathed by the Goddess's wrath, but there
is something changed about it, something very different indeed. Perhaps
it is the very light blue-greenish tint to everything. To the west,
the rest of the keep awaits.</pre>
