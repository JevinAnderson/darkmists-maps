  <h1>A drop in the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The descent into the tunnel is back with certainty, plummeting off into
fathomless depths below the surface.  Everything about this place forces
your gaze further into the depths of the tunnel.  There are ethereal strands
of webbing upon which you might be able to find footing to climb out or
further in.  Loose clumps of dark brown clay occasionally break loose and
come tumbling down the shaft.  A sickeningly sweet smell of old dust and
rosewater is overpowering, adding to the strange sensation of  this bizarre
place.
You may want to take your time, as a slip in here could mean death.</pre>
