In bas-relief next\nto the door is the figure of a scribe with a feathered pen\nwriting a tome. The expression on the scribe's face appears\nto be that of inspired joy. The door to the building is\nclosed, but it does not appear to be locked. Above this door\nis a golden plaque bearing two names. The one above reads,\n'ILPHRYNN DARMO'CHE' and the one below reads, 'PATRICK\nWILLIAM LYNCH'.",

Strapped to the back and\nwaist side of the Knight are a multitude of different types of weapons.\nSome glowing with the same eerie hum as the longsword and others looking\nrather dull grey compared to those that do glow.  Upon the chest plate of\nthis knight, an insignia of some kind can be seen.  It is a very Large Warhammer.\nUpon the shoulder guards of the knight there is a symbol of a Dagger.\nThe large shield is adorned by a symbol as well, that of a huge Broadsword."

One day he robbed a Paladin\nand got much gold from the Knight's wears.  The gang turned\non him when they seem how much he got from his loot,\nironically he was saved by a under-dressed knight, that\nhe robbed.  Vledimire was amazed that a man would save\nhim even after he robbed him down to nothing.  Thus the\nknight took the young warrior under his wings and taught\nhim the ways of the Paladins.  The virtues of obedience\nand honour would be come the things Vledimire now cherished.\nAfter training for years as a squire for knights, he\nwatched and seen how they were slowly becoming as prideful\nand arrogant as the evil they were trying to deminish.\nHe asked why they would use the blessed magics to simply\ndo chores that we could do on our own with little energy\non their own.  His questions were met with obscure looks\nand low snarls.  Once he reached the ranking of Knight\nhe set out on his own.  He bid the knight that took him\nin farewell, as do all squires when they reach knighthood.\nHe sought to find why he felt this way, and find others\nthat felt the same way as he did.  He leaves his life in\nthe hands of fate.  He shall venture into Thera and find\nout more about this...Crusader and the Lord Darkwood that\nguides them in a code of Honor.

A black ichor\nseeps from their corners, running in tiny rivulets down his sunken cheeks.\nThe white, feathered wings of an angel sprout from his back, yet, they\nare by no means beautiful. Chunks of the downy feathers have been torn\nfree and the same black ichor that leaks from his eyes is spattered\nin thick globs across their impressive span. His slender, nearly skeletal,\nfingers bear jagged, two-inch talons which he slowly clicks against\none another. A rapier, its hilt bound with tarnished silver cording,\nrests loosely in the unadorned, red-leather scabbard fastened about\nhis waist upon a belt of woven intestines. Hanging from the other side\nof this disgusting belt is a five-headed whip of writhing, black flames."
