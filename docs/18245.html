    <h1 class="room-header">Along a path of polished stone</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">The stone beneath you is polished almost to a perfect shine. There
are some imperfections, though, as if someone had chipped at it in
places, though not too many places. To the east, a rocky cliff rises.
Southward, the path is rougher and begins to rise. To the west you
see lush green grass dotted with flowers of brilliant hues. The
sound of water falling rapidly into a pool delights your ears from
the north, and looking in that direction, you see that the path
continues, polished and flat as it is here.</pre>
