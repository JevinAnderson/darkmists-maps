  <h1>Hall of Equality</h1>
  <pre>The Hall of Equality was a concept of Lord Riallus, and was made to recognize
that all wizards, regardless of their paths or devotions, can come together
and work for the betterment of magic.  This hall holds the three common rooms
of the Circles of Conclave.  Straight ahead to the east, and in the middle of
the hallway, is the common room of the Circle of Twilight.  The room to the
north belongs to the Circle of Dawn, and the south, the Circle of Night (it
smells a little 'funny' in that direction).</pre>
