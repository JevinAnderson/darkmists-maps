  <h1>Interrogation Room</h1>
  <pre>Occasionally, prisoners have information that the Covenant may
want, but the prisoners refuse to give.  To solve this problem,
this interrogation room was built.  The long tables have a variety
of non lethal interrogation implements usable only by Covenant
soldiers.  Finger clamps, hot irons, a rod of shocking, and other
items are scattered on the tables along with some potions of
healing and regeneration and bottles of medicinal herbs.  A stretching
rack and a chair with clamps sit near the back of the room, both
polished and wiped clean of sweat and other bodily fluids that prisoners
sometimes deposit on them.</pre>
