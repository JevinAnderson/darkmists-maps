  <h1>Pasture</h1>
  <pre>Through the enlightened methods of irrigation, the Lord of the
Manor was able to turn this edge of the desert into a lush pasture
for the use of his cattle and sheep. Far to the west is the barn.
To the south are houses, and to the east, one small house with its
door hanging open.</pre>
