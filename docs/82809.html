  <h1>Before the Altar</h1>
  <pre>The halls of the castle are simple yet elegant.  A finely woven blue
carpet runs down the middle of the walkway.  Small crosses in a darker
hue of blue are sewn into the carpet at equal intervals.  Beautiful
white marble tile can be seen to either side of the carpet.  Torches
are lit along the hallway giving off a flickering illumination. To the
South, a place of reverance can be seen.  An altar sits dedicated to
the tenants of Valor, Courage, and Honor.  In this room, the knights
can prepare themselves to go before the altar to meditate.  A fountain
flows here, quenching their thirst, and also allowing them to properly
wash themselves before going into the holy room to the South.</pre>
