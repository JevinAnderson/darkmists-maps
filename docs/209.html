  <h1>Road to the Vale of Clover</h1>
  <pre>You are on an old road which runs alongside a clear stream.  It leads
to the Vale of Clover, a small valley at the foot of the mountains.
Looking down the road, you see a small village nestled beside a bend
in the stream.  Tall heather blows in the wind and you see some cows
grazing idly nearby.  The road east runs down into a wooded dell.</pre>
