  <h1>End of the Humming Ethereal Passage</h1>
  <pre>You are at the base of a violently humming tunnel. A purple and black tear in
the fabric of reality floats in the center of the room, beckoning to you. The
walls of this place are made of a strange ethereal fabric that is spongy and
sticky to the touch, while a lake of vile looking ooze congeals beneath you.
The walls hum with an intsense psionic energy, and seem to register your
unwelcome presence with hostility. You feel your mind exerting a constant
effort justto keep a strange presence from turning your brain to scrambled
eggs. The effort to focus is exhausting, yet the flow of mana coursing its
way through your body also seems to be increased. You may ascend back up
the ethereal passage if you choose, but why bother?</pre>
