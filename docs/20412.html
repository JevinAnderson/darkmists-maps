  <h1>A woody alcove</h1>
  <pre>You are surrounded from north, east, and south by thick woodland, tall trees
and lush green bushes. High above you the trees have formed a natural canopy,
blocking much of the sunlight. At the edges of the stone-hard, soil-strewn
path are low growing flowering plants with bright green leaves and tiny blos-
soms of deep purple. A sweet fragrance fills the air here, and the sound of
buzzing alerts you to the presence of honey bees. Once in a while you see one
sipping nectar from the human thumbnail-sized deep purple flowers.</pre>
