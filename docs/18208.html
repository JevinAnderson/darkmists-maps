  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>A natural rock path extends north and south over uneven ground
here. On either side of it, tall trees with thick, coarse trunks
tower above, shading all with a canopy of thick leaves. Closer
to the ground, a number of thick, thorny shrubs surround the
trees and reach out toward those who travel the path.</pre>
