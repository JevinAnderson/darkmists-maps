  <h1>The Massive Cavern of the Lady of Purity</h1>
  <pre>You are struck by the sheer size of Joja's library. A number
of books grace the bookshelves here which were carved from
the stone itself. Throughout the library a number of chairs
are scattered. Next to each chair is a standing sconce bearing
a single dark blue candle kept constantly lit. The hard rock
floor is covered by a huge carpet of many colors, with dark
blue dominating and contrasting with gold, crimson, green,
purple, and orange.</pre>
