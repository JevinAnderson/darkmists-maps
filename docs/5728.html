  <h1>The Crusader Canteen</h1>
  <pre>This is the Crusader Canteen. Behind the thick oak counter stands the giant
shopkeeper. Various goods are stacked in an orderly way on shelves behind the
counter. Crates of all shapes and sizes lie stacked all about. Torches on the
south and north walls provide this room with a dim lighting. An exit lies to
the west, from which direction you smell the scent of alcohol.</pre>
