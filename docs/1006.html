  <h1>The Past</h1>
  <pre>Seemingly out of place, this room is an oddity. It feels wrong,
misplaced, out of its climate. The walls are of blue marble, the
floor of a deep green. They are vibrant, colorful - at least, they
should be. A sickly film has settled over everything. Not wet,
exactly, but filmy, sticky; it is unsettling. It mutes the colors,
somewhat, casting a shadow over this room. It attempts to be vibrant,
but fails miserably at the task. In the upper right hand corner is
a fairly visible crack, black, cold against the attempts at bright
color. As you look more carefully, however, hairline cracks are
present all over the marble, leaving no corner untouched.</pre>
