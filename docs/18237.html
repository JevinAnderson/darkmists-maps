  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path extends to the north and south as it
encircles a miniature forest garden. To the east, cracked
boulders serve as a perch for a number of small weather-
hardy pine and fir trees whose trunks have been blown in
different directions over time, resulting in twisted trunks
and cascading branches. They remain alive and cling to life.
To the west, the ground is covered with moss and grasses,
and the small trees growing there are deciduous, subject to
the will of the seasons, with leaves budding, growing, turning
darker green and then brilliant gold and scarlet, and finally,
brittle brown, falling from bare winter branches rustling in
the boreal winds. In miniature, these trees are exquisite at
any time of the year.</pre>
