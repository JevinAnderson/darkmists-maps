    <pre class="room-description">You stand in a cavern north of the waterfall. From that waterfall water
sprays in. The cavern itself is moderately lit by silver torches on the
eastern half, and wooden torches set in silver sconces on the western
half. The flames burn a brilliant blue, rather than the usual fiery hues
of orange and yellow. Between the torches on the eastern half are large
shields bearing the Lechium Family Crest. Between the torches on the
western half are jeweled mosaics in the shape of a deep blue rose whose
green thorny stem ends in a quill tip. There is no furniture here, but
you do see a sign above an open entrance to the east. Where one would
expect to see an open entrance to the west is, instead, a silver-barred
gate which leaves no room to sneak through, under, or over.</pre>
