  <h1>A Dwindling Forest Path</h1>
  <pre>The forest path begins to dwindle here.  It's obvious you've entered
a part of the forest seldom visited by anyone.  You notice the richness
of the flora here, with a wider and thicker range of herbs growing in
wild abandon across the ground or in small cul-de-sacs formed at the
roots of the oak trees.  You hear a rustle in the bushes, but staring
intently without trying to look too obvious, you notice nothing.</pre>
