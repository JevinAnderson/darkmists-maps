  <h1>The Mountain Forge</h1>
  <pre>Heat blasts you from a furnace built neatly into the north wall.  Above
the furnace hangs a set of iron plates, hammered into different faces of
dwarves.  You recognize the name 'Kortho' under one face plate.  The
rest of the room includes an anvil, a rack with a set of hammers and
tongs, and other tools necessary for forging.  The entire layout is a
bit more primitive than one would expect from a dwarf.  An iron door
opens the way to the east.</pre>
