  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>The rock-hard, soil-strewn path curves here, stretching before you to the
west and the south. Arching above you, the tree branches form a tunnel from
their canopy of leaves. Lush, green leafy bushes grow near the path. At the
base of their trunks are ground cover plants, little scarlet flowers and
bright green leaves lending a little color to the dark path.</pre>
