  <h1>In the Emerald Forest</h1>
  <pre>The path here runs around a low grassy mound.  Looking closer, you see
the smallest of windows built into the mound.  It appears this is a
faerie hill, from which the faerie Rades ride out in celebration
through the wood paths of the Emerald Forest.  The angry face of a
faerie suddenly stares out at you from the window and interrupts your
scrutiny with a string of curses.</pre>
