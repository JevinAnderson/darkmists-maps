  <h1>The bridge over the gurgling stream</h1>
  <pre>Stretching northward and southward, the natural rock path
encircles a deep pool of water. It forms a rock bridge here,
stradling the gurgling stream from the west which empties,
by way of a small waterfall, into the water below to the
east. Above, a hole in the canopy of leaves allows the sun
to shine brightly during the day, both upon the path and
bridge, and the water below and to the east.</pre>
