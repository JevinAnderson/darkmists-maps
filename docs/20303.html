    <pre class="room-description">Two great pillars of smooth brown and grey striated stone stand at either
side of a huge opening in similarly striated rock. Polished, it gleams in the
available light. The rock face seems to have always been exposed to the air,
but old musty tomes speak of a time when this thing was unseen, covered
perhaps by dirt and soil, held by the roots of trees. Huge towering trees do
grow here, however, and they lend a canopy covering as though a natural
tunnel led to this place. To enter through the opening in the striated rock
face is to enter a more closed-in tunnel. Eastward, the pathway slopes upward
into forest land.</pre>
