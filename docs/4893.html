  <h1>Third Floor</h1>
  <pre>The granite floor is smooth and without flaw, polished to a shine. The feld-
spar and mica glint in the glow of your light. Polished golden sconces adorn
the walls. Engraved in the round walls are names, some familiar, some
obscure. There are several columns, also bearing names. The names are old
names, famous names in some cases, not famous in others. Leading upward, a
polished silver staircase shows signs that someone has been taking good care
of things here. A dark spot on the grey stone floor reveals itself to be an
obsidian stair leading downward. This downward leading stair is in excellent
repair. The southern wall bears an archway leading to another room. The
archway is lined with blocks of the same granite stone as is found on the
floor.</pre>
