  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>A green leafy canopy shades this east and west stretch of hard, soil-strewn
pathway, shading it so much that you need a light source if your eyes do not
otherwise discern things in the dark. Along the path on the north and south,
small plants grow, their green leaves and pretty red and pink flowers giving
color to the darkness. Their fragrance fills the air here, and it attracts
honey bees. You hear their buzzing, but only occasionally do you notice one
sipping nectar from a red or pink blossom. Just beyond those low growing
plants are thick shrubs bearing sweet berries.</pre>
