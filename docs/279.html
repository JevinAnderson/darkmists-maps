  <h1>The Southern border</h1>
  <pre>You are skirting the southern border of the Emerald Forest. A sheer
mountain face blocks any further exploring to the south and east,
while the forest streches on to the north and to the west. A fallen
log lies here, softing morning due and rain spray clinging to its
sparkling bark. No rotting scent seems to come from it as most
logs would emit.</pre>
