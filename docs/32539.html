  <h1>Within a Strange Alcove</h1>
  <pre>One would think that the concept of 'commerce' is beneath such creatures
as the illithid, but yet here lies what must only be construed as a shop.
There is nothing to distinguish this alcove from the others, yet the walls
of this place shimmer and hum with an intense psionic energy, acting more as
mental barriers than physical ones.  It is almost as if the architect of this
alcove used sheer imagination and mental will to construct its form.</pre>
