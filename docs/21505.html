    <pre class="room-description">This room is very simple.  Along the eastern wall, a couple windows look
out into the depths of the forest.  One has been left open to provide a small
bit of circulation to the occupants.  A fireplace has been set in the northern
wall, but is currently unlit.  Heavy oak tables with stiff chairs are here for
the purpose of debate and discussion, as well as for focusing the mind when
studying.  Small plants have been placed around the room to make the room
more appealing, with mixed results.  A small fountain in the southern wall
gurgles softly, as if it were afraid to disturb the people in here.</pre>
