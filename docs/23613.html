    <h1 class="room-header">Chief Magistrate's Office</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">This office is sparsely decorated. A massive desk sits facing the door
while sturdy looking wooden chair sits behind it. A small potted plant
sits by a large window on the eastern wall through which you can see the
surrounding lands. To the east you can make out the small village of
Shadowdale and south of that, the new city of Sudharma. You can also see
a path of iridescent stones trailing off from the stronghold to the east.
Bookshelves line both the northern and southern walls of the room and are
filled with numerous tomes about the law and various other subjects. A
deep-blue colored rug covers part of the marble floor with the Seal of
Justice at its center. You may exit back to the stairwell to the west.</pre>
