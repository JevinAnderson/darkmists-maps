  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>A green leafy canopy shades this east and west stretch of hard, soil-strewn
pathway, shading it so much that you need a light source if your eyes do not
otherwise discern things in the dark. Along the path on the north and south,
small plants grow, their green leaves and pretty white and violet flowers
giving color to the darkness. Their fragrance fills the air here, and it
attracts honey bees. You hear their buzzing, but only occasionally do you
notice a honey bee sipping nectar from one of the little flowers. Just beyond
the low growing plants are thick, green-leaved shrubs. The dark path stretches
eastward. To the west you see some light, and what appears to be a pond.</pre>
