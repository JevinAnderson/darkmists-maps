  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>A path formed of natural rock leads southward through a lush garden.
Unlike most gardens, this one has a more wild, natural look to it.
To either side of the rock path, trees grow, their trunks thick and
coarse, their canopies offering a pleasant shade to those who travel
here. Numerous shrubs also grow here, adding thick foliage to the
lower part of the garden. A sign has been set in the soil near one
of the tall trees.</pre>
