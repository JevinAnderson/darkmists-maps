    <h1 class="room-header">Along a path of polished stone</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">The stone beneath you is polished almost to a perfect shine. The few
imperfections you see serve only to highlight the smoothness of the
surface. To the east, a sheer cliff of craggy rock rises upward. West-
ward is a modest body of water, of a clear blue, reflecting the sky
and yet allowing you to see the floor of this large spring, where you
can view small plant life, multicolored rocks and stones, and maybe,
just maybe, a glimpse of something living down there. The delightful
sound of falling water comes to you from the north, and you see that
the path continues in that direction, polished and flat as it is here.
Water falls into the spring from about halfway up the rock wall to the
north, splashing into the clear blue water. Directly to the west across
the spring is another sheer cliff, and about two-thirds up, a waterfall
rushes to a ledge, where the water seems to gather and rush along to the
north and then falls rapidly down into the spring. Some overflow streams
downward along that western cliff face as the water makes its way north-
ward toward the final fall.</pre>
