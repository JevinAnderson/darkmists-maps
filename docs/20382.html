Streaks of softly glowing gold lichen run across the striated walls above the
twenty-foot mark, and reach upward toward the ceiling where they glow very
softly, almost a pastel yellow. The bottom twenty feet of wall on the north,
west, and south, are hollowed out just enough to form natural rock shelves.
In the middle of the dark floor is a table-like altar formed of the same stone
as the walls. A perfectly sized slab of bloodstone rests upon the top of this
altar stone, and upon it rests a book. There is just enough light to read this
book, and any other which is to be found on the shelves here. In the northwest
corner a marble statue rises up, tall as a giant, of a warrior in spiked armor
wielding a battlestaff in one hand and a shield in the other, one foot upon
the body of what appears to be a fallen mage, whose left hand holds a broken
stave carved with magical runes. To the east is a vaulted archway, huge and
wide, such that a giant or two might pass through without touching rock.</pre
