  <h1>The Halls of Memory</h2>
  <pre>You stand in a grand open space just inside the keep of the castle.  The
ceiling arches overhead, forming a large dome of stone which travels a long
ways into the Keep. The walls and the floors are cut from the finest grade of
stone. The placement of each stone is with near perfection, impressing anyone
with the knowledge of architecture. Numerous pictures of famed battles
entirely cover the walls and ceilings, and famous Crusader legends adorn the
hall in the form of lifelike marble statues. The glory of the past thrives
with life as one walks the halls of memories.</pre>
