    <h1 class="room-header">The Western Bloodfall</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">This room is lit only by torchlight, giving it an ominous glow.
It seems that the torches continue to burn without end, an eternal
hunger of flame and light. The light flickers, casting many
shadows throughout this chamber of gargantuan proportions. The
torches, set into stands of dark wrought-iron, reveal shadowy
forms. The northeastern end of the chamber is nothing but a river
of swirling blood, extending eastward, going into a rather large
hole worn into the wall. The blood cascades into the pool from
above, a bloodfall. No natural occurrence, this must have been
wrought of some dark will, for a reason so twisted as to be
understood only to the Creator. A stone ledge is set around the
pool, spattered with little splashes of dried blood. The tunnel
that leads the blood to the east is dark, revealing nothing within.
Through the flickering firelight, you can barely make out a set of
steep stone stairs leading upward, to the source of the falls.
South, the natural stone succumbs to carved marble once more.</pre>
