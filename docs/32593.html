  <h1>Invasion Chamber</h1>
  <pre>This room serves as the primary nexus for the inhabitants of the hive to
invade the surface in conquest of yet more brains upon which to feed and
nourish the hivemind.  A shimmering and crackling psionic portal in the center
of the room is the focus of attention as illithid creatures occasionally enter
the chamber and flit through the portal.  The chamber walls shimmer and hum
with an intense psionic energy, acting more as mental barriers than physical
ones.  It is almost as if the architect of this Chamber used sheer imagination
and mental will to construct its form.</pre>
