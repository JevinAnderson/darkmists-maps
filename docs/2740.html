  <h1>Library</h1>
  <pre>Among the books on the table in this finely decorated room are
'Animal Husbandry', 'Crop Rotation Theory', 'Natural and Forced
Irrigation', and 'Life Without Magic'. The library extends to
the east. A wooden plaque hangs on the northern wall. On the
western wall near the window is a faded parchment in a weathered
frame. The ink near the top is faded and old, the ink near the
bottom fresh and dark looking.</pre>
