  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>The hard rock, soil-strewn path branches to the south, east, and west. High
trees lend a canopy cover to keep it well shaded. A few lush green bushes
grow here, their branches somehow well tended. To the east and west the path
merely stretches on through the woodland tunnel. To the south, however, it
slopes downward.</pre>
