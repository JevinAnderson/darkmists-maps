  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>To the east and west the stony passage stretches, the walls on your north and
south of striated stone covered with softly glowing lichen which lends its
light to the pathway. High above, the ceiling is dark. To the east, the path
takes a turn. To the west you see a T-shaped intersection where the cavern
has widened.</pre>
