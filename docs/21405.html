  <h1>Western Womb</h1>
  <pre>Upon entering, the squalid surroundings are immediately noticeable.
Squishy and slimy animal droppings are scattered all throughout the
walls and on the cave floor, making trekking by foot an unpleasant
experience for most creatures.  A single pillar standing boldly in
the middle of the hollow cavern diverts one's attention from the dingy
walls.  Of remarkable height, the majestic stalagmite formation made
of calcite, iron and water stretches from the soiled cave floor to
the domed ceiling.  There is something captivating in the way its
translucence is tainted by the reddish-brown streaks that cover the
structure like smears of dried blood.  A din of echoes could be heard
here.</pre>
