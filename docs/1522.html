  <h1>Ranger Corps Recreation Room</h1>
  <pre>Somehow, Lady Drinlinda managed to create a self contained forest
in a room underneath a mountain.  This miniature forest has a
small stream, medium sized trees, and even the very realistic
illusion of a sky complete with sun and weather patterns that
mimics the weather outside.  The Ranger Corps has made this its
recreation room, practicing their woodland skills and growing
various herbs here for eating, healing, and selling to others.</pre>
