  <h1>A Dark Hallway</h1>
  <pre>The hallway is fairly bland and the only things to see are the
everburning torches lining the walls.  It is very quiet in here,
the only sounds that can be heard are the echoes from your own
movements.  A darkened mithril ladder leading upwards is here,
allowing access to the upper floors.  A room that is nearly pitch
black lies to the east, and a room filled with an assortment of
tools lies to the west.</pre>
