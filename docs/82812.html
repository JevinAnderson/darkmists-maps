  <h1>The stables</h1>
  <pre>In the stables an air of animal musk hangs heavily.  Straw covers
much of the floor here.  Channels in the floor are used to wash away
the muck and grime that comes from the steeds themselves.  Along the
walls, various tools can be seen for shoeing horses.  Feed buckets
sit nicely along one wall.  Another wall holds many harness, bit, and
bridle.  A stack of beautiful blue cloth sits in one corner, that is
used to drape over the steeds.</pre>
