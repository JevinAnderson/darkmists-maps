  <h1>The Wood Area</h1>
  <pre>The trail leading south from here starts sloping downward into a
richer wood area. The undisturbed nature of the flora suggests that
this is a rarely travelled part of the forest even by its own
standards. A small mouse-deer runs across the trail, followed by
a lazy looking lynx. To the north you can just make out a clearing
through the trees, and there seems to be movement.</pre>
