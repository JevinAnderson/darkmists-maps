  <h1>The Guildmaster's Cabin</h1>
  <pre>Built from the logs of sturdy cypress trees from the Vale of Clover,
the Guildmaster's cabin has a homely feel to it.  Oaks have grown their
low branches across the roof of the cabin and any number of small forest
animals race along the length of the porch.  Elesar of the Woods is here,
instructing a young woodkeeper.</pre>
