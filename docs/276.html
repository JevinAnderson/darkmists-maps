  <h1>Woodkeeper's Clearing</h1>
  <pre>The path ends in a medium sized clearing. A small wooden sign states
quite dogmatically "WoodKeeper's Clearing. Forest haters not welcomed.
Orcs, Bugbears and Goblins keep out!". A number of elves and humans
dressed in a mixture of green and brown stand around here engaging in
friendly conversation. The actual Keeper's Meet hasn't started yet,
apparently there are rangers from distant woodlands still trying to
make it for the meeting. A pile of scrolls sit on a small table,
probably pamphlets to be distributed to the arriving participants of
the meeting.</pre>
