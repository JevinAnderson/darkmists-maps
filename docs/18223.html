    <pre class="room-description">The natural rock path stretches before you to the east and
west. Toward the west, it seems to meet at a convergence of
paths, rising upward. To the north and south of the path,
thin trunked trees rise, their bark smooth and grey except
where it peels, naturally, from the trunk. These trees have
not a thick foliage canopy, but thin, intermittant shade,
allowing the sunlight, during the day, to filter through.
Thick, large-leaved shrubs grow between the tree trunks, and
huge-leafed ivy covers the ground. Along the south side of
the path, a stream flows toward the east. Its origin seems
to be with the pool to the west.</pre>
