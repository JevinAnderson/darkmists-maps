    <pre class="room-description">You stand in the entry hall of a once austere mansion, now fallen
into decadence and disrepair.  Wooden planks line the floor that
tends to give a somewhat disheartening squeak as it creaks under
your weight.  A maroon rug, muddy and stained, runs the length of
the entryway to deeper within this rundown estate.  On the walls
hang pictures of seemingly nefarious individuals, grinning at you
with self-assured smiles.  Beneath the oil portraits are golden
plaques naming the subjects, revealing them to be the previous
Godfathers of the Syndicate.  Burnished candleholders are fastened
between the paintings, though only provide a a small measure of
light to this gathering place of criminals and wanted men.  Maybe
there's a reason why only a few of the candles are lit.  The rug
can you lead deeper into this repository of crime, or a large oak
door opens to the turbulent streets of Arkham.</pre>
