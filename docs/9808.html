  <h1>The Thug's Den</h1>
  <pre>Not very good care has been given to this room from the looks of
it. The covering of the walls seems to be falling off in spots;
the floor is a complete mess covered in pieces of random clothing
and bedding items. There are various beds of different sizes
lining the walls.  Some seem to be made for those of giant
stature and others look like a gnome or halfling would fit
snugly under the blankets.</pre>
