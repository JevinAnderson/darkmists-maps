  <h1>General Shoppe within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The striated walls to the north and south are covered with softly glowing
lichen whose natural light brightens the environs. Toward the west appears to
be an alcove filled with stuff. A naturally hewn counter holds a number of
items. Behind it stands a slim fellow who is the proprietor of this shoppe.
High above you, the ceiling is dark. Below you, the ground is also dark. To
the east is a turn in the passage through the underground hewn into this huge
stone.</pre>
