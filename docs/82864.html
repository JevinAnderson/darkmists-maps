  <h1>The compound triage</h1>
  <pre>The triage is made from the same stone and marble as the rest of the compound,
but is stained in places with old blood. A tapestry hangs on the north wall
depicting a soldier kneeling in front of a shadowy figure. The polished marble
floor, at least the spots not stained with blood, reflects the light from
suspended glowing spheres.</pre>
