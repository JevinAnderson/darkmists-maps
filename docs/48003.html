  <h1>Junction in the Hallway</h1>
  <pre>The mansion's long hallway abruptly widens, providing access to all
the cardinal directions.  In this room at least, light defeats the
otherwise pervasive darkness.  A large chandelier hangs dangerously
low from the ceiling, infusing a glimmering light throughout this
meeting of paths.  The creaky floors actually manage to sag in some
places, though never quite breaking.  Random sheets of papers are
scattered throughout the room, probably copies of the reports given
to the Syndicate officials who use this building as a safe house.
You can continue to the west, south, and east.</pre>
