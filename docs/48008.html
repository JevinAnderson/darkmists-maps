This place must be one of the Syndicate's hubs of information.  Well looked
after and aesthetically pleasing, this study contains basically everything
you would expect it to.  Candleabras are fastened to the walls, providing
a good deal of light for the Syndicate's officials to peruse reports and
deal with the numerous issues brought to their attention daily.  A large desk
faces you immediately upon entering, behind which hangs a large portrait of
Rellion, the Eternal Godfather.  Other papers are nailed to the wall detailing
important status updates of the Syndicate's many business interests in Thera.
That same red carpet leads the way back to the top of the stairs, though here
the carpet is in pristine condition.</pre
