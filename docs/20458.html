  <h1>Small Cottage</h1>
  <pre>This small cottage is neat and clean. The interior is decorated with
necessities: a mat for two for sleeping, a low table with pillows
for eating, a counter for food preparation. On the table is a simple
brass vase, holding a bouquet of pink carnations. The only sharp tools
in the cottage are food preparation tools, a set of knives and
cleavers hanging on one wall above the counter. Below the counter
are a collection of metal pans and pots. On hooks along another
wall is a collection of dainty tea cups made of porcelain.</pre>
