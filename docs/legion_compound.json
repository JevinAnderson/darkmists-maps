These flags were only created\nand given on the account of a war being started bewtween the two factions. These\nflags can be rearned if the actions show that the wizard is against the order\nand is not just enjoying battles with soldiers for personal reasons, or\nenjoyment.\nTerm 3\nAll battles that will take place between both factions will be without the\ninvolvement of each others known enemeis. For instance, conclave will not strike\nsoldiers of the order with valor, or rebels.\nThis also means that soldiers of order will not strike wizards with the\nsteel clan members. Any battles that occur with either faction fighting their\nenemies and the waiting to strike a weakened foe will not be tolerated.\nNo soldier of my army will wait for a wizard raiding the steel confines, no\nwizard will wait to attack a soldier of mine raiding the valorian castle. If\nthere is to be battle between us\nit will be done when we are only fighting against each other for pride,\nreligion, cause, or desire.\nTerm 4\nThese battles will all be done in fair numbers, a foe against a foe, or two foes\nagainst one foe. Any numbers larger than that and punishment will be fierce,\nalso name calling and teasing will follow because of this pathetic display.\nFoes may enter battle in odd numbers only if another opponent has been added to\nthe battle. Such as, Quenton battles Evret and Criollo. Arion joins the battle\nso now one from either faction may join in without punishment.\nTerm 5\nThere is no allowance period to enter the magic tower or the compounds barracks.\nThere is absolutely no reason to go into these places unless your part of that\nfaction. The tower represents magic, the spectre, and the cubee all represent\nwhat that tower is.\nThe compound, the black dragon, and the sword of obsidian represent all that the\narmy is. To enter is to attack our beliefs and is an attack against what each\nother believes in.\nNO ENTRANCE AT ALL FOR ANY REASON, this can't be made any clearer.\nTerm 6\nAny enemies of either faction that are not well known for religous reasons, or\npersonal will be notified to each others factions so that there is no mistake of\nhelping each others enemies against one another.\nTerm 7\nWhen scrolls are penned about a break in the treaty it will contain this\ninformation.\nThe date, situation, place, people involved and be sent to Quenton and myself\ndirectly.\nQuenton and I will be taking stories from both sides, and finding the person of\nblame so that no one is pointing fingers or tentacles around until a war breaks\nout.\nAs previously stated, information from an outside source is welcome and can\ncontain multiple rewards for the person giving it.\nThis scroll will be finalized with the signatures of both parties in seperate\nparchments and is meant to contain the people from a pointless war that only\ndistracts them from their true callings.\nEvret the unfettered living hell, General of the Order"
