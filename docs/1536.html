  <h1>Covenant Bestiary</h1>
  <pre>The battledragons and nightmares of the Covenant army dwell here,
living without cages or stables of any sort.  Piles of food
for either type of creature are piled in the corners and a large
spring welling up from underground into a water trough provides
them with water.  The creatures themselves do whatever they want
to do, and when nature calls, they have a large trough filled with
dirt which channels downwards to the underground farm to use the
waste as fertilizer.</pre>
