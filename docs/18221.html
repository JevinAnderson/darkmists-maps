  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>On uneven ground, the natural rock path encircles the pool
to the south, sloping upward as it leads westward, downward
as it leads eastward. North of the path, tall trees grow,
their high branches extending a canopy of leaves out to shade
the path. The waters of the pool, however, remain exposed to
the direct sunlight during the day.</pre>
