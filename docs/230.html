  <h1>Under Dark Woods</h1>
  <pre>The path continues darkly under rows of Elder trees.  A crooked road
leads west through a tangled hedge of briars.  A mist prevents you from
looking beyond the hedge, but you sense a powerful and oppressive evil
reaching out towards you with cold and clawed fingers.  To the south,
the forest seems to lighten considerably, and you are about to leave
in that direction when a tattered parchment, flapping weakly in the
wind, falls at your feet.</pre>
