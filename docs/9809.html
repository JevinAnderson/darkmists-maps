  <h1>Hall</h1>
  <pre>A grand archway leads to a room to the end of this hallway. It
is covered with a thick black velvet drape. A path has been
worn into the floor and it leads down a narrow hallway to the
west. Torches line the hall way here, but no flames dance at
their ends, but rather a strange amber tinted light comes out
from where the flames should be.</pre>
