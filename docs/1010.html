  <h1>The Eternally Bound</h1>
  <pre>A punishment, a binding. A deep channel flows through the center
of this long, endless chamber. Black liquid floats stagnantly
within, but an irregularity interrupts the stream. The channel
becomes a pool, a few feet across. The long dead corpse of a wretch
stares up at you with its cold gaze. Chains still hold the beast
to the one time place of its imprisonment, a captive even in death.
It is not wise to cross the Dark Lords, it would seem. The chamber
is open, huge; the floor is far below the surface of the land, and
the chamber is expansive. The floor is littered with charred remains,
flakes of stone, cracked pieces of dull rock. Puddles of sticky film
are spotted about, dark splotches on dark rock. The channel, cut
into the ground, extends to your east and west. To the southwest, a
fiery glow reflects upon the strands of gossamer that cloak the entire
chamber. An unsettling feeling takes you as you search the room with
your gaze, as if someone, or something, watches you.  A chill runs
up your spine as a hollow scream of agony, of utmost despair echoes
in your mind.  Only after you stop shivering do you begin to realize
that there had been no sound.  A need to leave this place begins
to overwhelm you.</pre>
