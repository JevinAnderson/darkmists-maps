  <h1>The Hall of History</h2>
  <pre>As you enter the hall of history you are forced to sneeze from the dust
gathered about. Shelves, cases, storage bins, and racks of every sort litter
the room. Relics, ancient weapons, shields, figurines, old maps, cloaks,
armor, anything old that relates to war or Crusader history seems to be
collected here.  Brass, steel, iron, stone, different woods, gems, myriad
piles of material glimmer in the light. Layers of dust pile on many of the
items. You wonder how many treasures are hidden about in this room.</pre>
