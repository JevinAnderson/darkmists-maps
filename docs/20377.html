    <pre class="room-description">Huge barrels line the northern rock wall in Barr's Brewery. The spigots
remain locked in place, keeping the brew inside the barrels so that it may
age properly. The eastern wall is lined with tables, upon which are herbs and
spices being mixed to be added to the special drinks served here. Along the
southern wall is what can only be called a distillery: A huge vat is
suspended by huge iron chains over a hot fire, and the liquid being boiled
within is allowed to escape through a series of thick glass tubes, ending up
in a huge barrel sitting on its side near the eastern wall. It is assumed
that when a barrel is emptied by the patrons of the bar, the new brew is set
in its place to age, and the empty barrel set up to receive the next new brew.</pre>
