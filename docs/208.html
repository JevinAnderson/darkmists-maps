  <h1>A Fae Crossing</h1>
  <pre>The path has taken you to a junction over which hangs the twisted
branches of two Blackthorn trees and an Elderwood tree.  You remember
folktales which tell that spiteful faeries lurk under the meetings of
such trees to waylay and confound woodland travellers.  Feeling a little
uncomfortable, you look south, where the forest seems to darken
menacingly.  The east trail beckons you to the safety of the Emerald
Forest.</pre>
