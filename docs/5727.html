    <h1>The Crusader Bar</h1>
    <pre>
You enter a cavern with stacks of beer barrels. On the western side a few
large racks hold many bottles of wine in them. A large wooden counter serves
as a bar with many sturdy stools surrounding it. A large minotaur with a
patch over one eye grunts as he fills orders. A large knife board rests on
the southern wall for throwing practice and entertainment. Many more barrels
line the exit to the east.</pre
