  <h1>The Witch Wood</h1>
  <pre>You are deep in the Witch Wood.  The evil that taints these woods grows
palpable here.  Directly to your north is a wall of shifting shadows that
your light cannot penetrate.  Tall reeds with thorny blades grow around
a path that leads west into the mists.  The forest lies to your east and
south.</pre>
