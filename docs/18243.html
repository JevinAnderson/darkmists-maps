  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path extends to the north and south as it
encircles a miniature forest garden. To the west, the
ground is covered with moss and grasses, and the small trees
growing there are deciduous, subject to the will of the
seasons, with leaves budding, growing, turning darker green
and then brilliant gold and scarlet, and finally, brittle
brown, falling from bare winter branches rustling in the
boreal winds. In miniature, these trees are exquisite at any
time of the year. To the west, a couple of fern trees grow
amidst small bushes with tiny, brilliant red roses blooming
within thorny cages.</pre>
