  <h1>Wading in the Spring</h1>
  <pre>You found your way into the spring water which forms a small shallow lake
at the base of the rocky cliffs. The water is a clear blue color, reflecting
the sky above, yet allowing one to see the lakebed below. You can tell that
there are little plants growing there, and small fish occasionally show
themselves as they dart from one plant to another. The shallow lake extends
to the north, where a waterfall fills it constantly. Looking at the lakebed
again, you do not see where the water might be draining, and yet the level
is always the same.</pre>
