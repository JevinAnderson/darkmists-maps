  <h1>Field</h1>
  <pre>Through the enlightened methods of irrigation, the Lord of the
Manor was able to turn this edge of the desert into usable
cropland. Rows and rows of grain and vegetable crops grow well
here, irrigated from the river to the north. A thick row of
shrubs and trees grows to the west, serving as a windblock.</pre>
