  <h1>The Dead Moors</h1>
  <pre>Everything is black here.  The fogs rolls into the edge of the woods to
the north, while in every other direction the desolate marshes darken
your spirits.  Small creatures are feeding on each other at your feet,
while others are clawing their way to the surface of the mud.  A sudden
wind blows the fog away, and you see a small lake through the tall reeds
to the west.</pre>
