  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path extend north and south, its bordering walls covered with a
naturally glowing lichen which lend soft light to the passageway. High above,
the ceiling is dark. From the south you hear soft sounds of activity. Or are
they coming from the north?</pre>
