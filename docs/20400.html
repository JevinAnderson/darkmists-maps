  <h1>On a path</h1>
  <pre>Depending on your point of view, the path either begins or ends here.
Surrounded on all but one side by beautiful, thick woodland, it is a quiet
place for contemplation or the sheer enjoyment of looking at trees unmarred
by civilization. Someone realized the value of this place and set a smooth,
zebrawood bench here to facilitate quiet contemplation. At the edges of the
path are tiny flowering plants, their soft violet flowers emitting a light
fragrance, and beyond them, thick green shrubs bearing sweet berries are to
be seen. The buzzing of honey bees can be heard, but only occasionally do
you see one sipping nectar from the tiny violet blooms.</pre>
