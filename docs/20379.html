  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path veers to the west and south here. It is lit by naturally glow-
ing lichen which cling to the walls. High above you is a dark ceiling, and
below you the stone floor is dark as well. To the north, a pair of silvery
mithril chains bearing a shingle hangs from the high, dark ceiling.</pre>
