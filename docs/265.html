  <h1>The Tree House</h1>
  <pre>This is a small platform with four walls and a leaf roof rather than
a proper tree house.  Nevertheless, it is very cosy and could accommodate
two quite comfortably.  A pot of jasmine tea is simmering over a fire
and a few plush cushions are scattered on a rug in one corner.  On a
shelf on the west wall are the complete works of Shakespeare, while
another book lies half-read on the floor.</pre>
