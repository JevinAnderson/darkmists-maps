  <h1>Small Cottage</h1>
  <pre>While it isn't much, this cottage is neat and clean. The interior is
decorated with the necessities: a comfortable but firm bed, a table
with chairs, a counter for preparations. Various weapons adorn the
walls, as much decoration as useful, blades clean and sharp. While
there is a rocking chair in the corner, one gets the impression that
whoever lives here is not exactly retired and on his deathbed. A
hook in the wall near the rocker holds a bright brass lantern.</pre>
