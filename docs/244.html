  <h1>In the Emerald Forest</h1>
  <pre>You are at a three-way junction in the middle of the woods.  Wild trumpet
creepers run along the footpaths here.  It would seem some mischievous
pixie has drawn the vines across the path with the hope of tripping
woodland travellers such as you.  You watch your step.</pre>
