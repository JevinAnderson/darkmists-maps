  <h1>A Hill in the Marsh</h1>
  <pre>You have come upon a low hill in the marsh.  As you ascend it, you
notice that the fog that covers the rest of the fens rolls away.  The
weeds are dry at the edge of the mound and the grass that grows here is
is lush and green.  A lone oak tree stands on the mound, like a beacon of
goodness that repels the evil of the witches.</pre>
