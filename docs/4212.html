    <h1 class="room-header">Before a Yawning Pit</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">You have set foot on desecrated ground, and it is likely that you will pay
for your trespass with your pitiful life.  All around you the earth has been
scorched and charred, as if hell itself opened up and formed a perfect rift
to populate with its denizens. Beyond the droning hum of insects, you can
make out an occasional scream. Smoke and ash plumes drift from the ground,
causing eye irritation. All around the pit small totems bearing the likeness
of foul beings have been erected.  They seem to be glaring in your direction.
The longer you remain, the more uncomfortable you become as the smell of blood
mixed with burning flesh assaults your olfactory senses with unabated force.
A vile place indeed lurks before you, and your senses advise you to turn back.</pre>
