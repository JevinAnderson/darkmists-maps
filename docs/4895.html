  <h1>Fifth Floor</h1>
  <pre>The floor is of polished zebrawood, its grain a pleasant natural design of
dark and light. A bin sits in the center of the room. Made of dark mahogany,
it contrasts with the polished zebrawood floor. All the walls have been
polished as well. Formed of panels of different woods, they contrast and
yet match one another. You recognize oak and maple, mahogany, zebrawood,
elm, pine, redwood, dogwood, and cherrywood. There are panels of woods you
have not seen before, or with whose origins you are not familiar. Hanging
on one of the darker panels of wood is a small sign. A polished wooden
stair leads upwards. Near the base of this stair, a hole in the floor
reveals a cast iron stair leading downward.</pre>
