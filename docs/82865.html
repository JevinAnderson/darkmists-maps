    <pre class="room-description">The stone walls of the training room are covered in tapestries depicting
soldiers in battle with one another. They serve not only as decoration, but to
dampen the sound of metal on metal that emanates from this room when the
soldiers of legion practice. The marble floor is covered with practice mats,
which have spots of dried blood where a careless blow struck a bit too close
to home. A few weapon racks line the walls, and a training dummy sits in the
south corner of the room.</pre>
