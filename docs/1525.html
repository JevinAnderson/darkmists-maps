  <h1>Officers' Quarters</h1>
  <pre>The highest ranking Covenant officers gain the use of this room,
which is second only to the General's quarters in terms of comfort
and lavishness.  Several soft bunks, unlike the hard as rock
bunks in the Knight Barracks, line the walls along with personal
footlockers.  A glowcrystal lamp hangs from the ceiling and a
double latrine is embedded into the wall beside the closets and
weapons and armor racks.  There appears to be a painting on the
wall.</pre>
