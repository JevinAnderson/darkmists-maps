    <h1 class="room-header">Along the garden path</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">The natural path veers southward, and slopes upward, and
eastward, sloping downward, as it encircles the deep pool
to the southeast. North and west of the path, tall trees
grow, their thick, coarsely barked trunks close together,
so that only thin, but tall, shrubs grow between them.
From above, the canopy of leaves lends shade to the path,
but it does not extend to the pool, which receives the
full brunt of the sun during the day. From here, looking
south, you can see the path rising upward, and a stone
bridge arching over something.</pre>
