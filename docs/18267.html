  <h1>The Greenhouse Above the Lechium Cavern</h1>
  <pre>Looking about the tower, you realize that you are standing
within a glass structure. The smooth stone floor rises up
at the walls to about six inches. Then the stone walls end
and the walls of glass begin. These walls are very thick
and by no means weak and shatter prone. Along the glass
walls are wooden tables fit perfectly with the curve. Upon
those tables are a number of small pots containing plants
in various stages of growth. The air here is humid and warm.
Beyond the thick panes you see a forest, and a garden with
a pathway running through it that seems to spell something.
Glittering in the light, a shiny silver stair leads downward.</pre>
