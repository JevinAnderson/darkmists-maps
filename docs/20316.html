    <pre class="room-description">The walls are formed of striated rock, polished to a sheen, and of the same
striated grey and brown that is found elsewhere in this underground part of
the city. A vaulted opening to the south allows passage out into the tunnels.
The northern wall is a built-in fireplace where very hot fire burns at all
times of the day and night. A chimney cut into the stone allows the smoke to
rise upward. The striated walls are bare of the glowing lichen found else-
where, for this forge creates too much heat for the lichen. Out a ways from
the forge fires is a great anvil, and the blacksmith's tools of the trade are
nearby. Along the walls are various pieces that the blacksmith has been work-
ing on, in various states of creation or repair.</pre>
