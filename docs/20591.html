  <h1>Sea of Sand</h1>
  <pre>In all directions, as far as you can sense, all you see is sand. It
is aptly named the Sea of Sand since the winds shift and churns the
sands into almost peaceful patterns. If it were not for the
oppressive heat that seems to suck the very life from your body the
constant motion of the sands might very well be soothing. The endless
sand is broken by a white stone that appears quite out of place here.</pre>
