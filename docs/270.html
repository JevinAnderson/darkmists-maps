  <h1>The three way woodland</h1>
  <pre>You stand at the middling spot of a three way woodland trail deep
in the Emerald Forest. There are clear passages to the north, west
and east, while the path to the south abruptly ends at the foot of a
sheer cliff face, with a wall so smooth that it would be impossible
to climb. A variety of bird song and animal sound fill the air.</pre>
