  <h1>Entrance to a Strange Chamber</h1>
  <pre>The pressure upon your brain is fading thankfully fast into a distant
memory. As with before, the portal seals behind you, leaving you with
no choice but to proceed forward. In the distance you make out a wide
variety of strange hunched figures floating about a large open chamber
without any regard for your presence.  The walls of this place shimmer
and hum with an intense psionic energy, acting more as mental barriers
than physical ones.  The only direction in which to proceed is north.</pre>
