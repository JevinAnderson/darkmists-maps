  <h1>The Southwest Turret</h1>
  <pre>The turret is simple in adornment, and meant to serve a specific purpose.
it grants a view of the grounds around the castle, so that intruders can
be watched for.  This turret overlooks the path to the Grey havens, as
well as providing a slightly blocked view of the halflings den to the
Southwest.  It also provides a fine view of the path leading right up
to the castle itself.  The fine marble of the rest of the place is not to
be found here.  Only the soft blue carpets still look like the rest.  The
stairs lead back down to the castle proper, and are also covered in the
fine blue carpetting.</pre>
