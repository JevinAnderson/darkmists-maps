  <h1>By the pond</h1>
  <pre>The hard soil-strewn path curves to the east, toward a dark foresty tunnel,
and toward the north, alongside a crystalline pond, its blue waters sparkling.
Along the edge of the pond, water herbs grow. The grass is green and healthy. Occasionally you notice a little movement beneath the surface of the pond
water, and can see some silvery fish swimming.</pre>
