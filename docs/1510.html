  <h1>A Dark Hallway</h1>
  <pre>The hallway is fairly bland and the only things to see are the
everburning torches lining the walls.  It is very quiet in here,
the only sounds that can be heard are the echoes from your own
movements.  To the east, a doorway leads to a very large room
with a bed and a lot of other things.  To the west is a similar
room with a couple of large beds and other items within.</pre>
