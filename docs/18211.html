  <h1>End of the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path leads to the west. To north, east, and
south are huge trees, giant redwoods, as thick as nine giants
in a huddle together. So close do these titanic trees grow to
one another that there is no room for shrubs. There are a few
small plants, however, which have begun to grow in the moist
soil here, despite crowded conditions. A small stone bench is
here, set at an angle to best enjoy the shade of the mighty
redwoods.</pre>
