  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path leads to east and west through the
forested garden. Alongside of it, to the south, a gurgling
stream rushes toward the east, heading downward as does
the path itself. Sunlight creeps through the canopy of
leaves above. Thick, thorny bushes reach out to travellers
on the path, luring with pretty flowers and delightful
scents.</pre>
