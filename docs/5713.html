  <h1>The Northeast Tower</h2>
  <pre>A howling whistle of wind and the draft of cool air welcomes you as you enter
the northeast tower of the castle. Strong granite stones masoned with excep-
tional skill form the cone that makes up the tower. Tall stairs lead upwards,
each step just below an average human's knee spiral to the top, where a bit
of extra stone exists which must be stepped over to fully enter the top tower
room. Along the circular tower wall murder holes give a field of observation
to that side of the castle, but unfortunately, not downward at the country-
side below. There seem to be some small markings on the wall hidden among the
various scratches and chips in the stone. Green moss grows between the goves
of the fine stone. A damp, cool breeze blows through this part of the tower.
Along the base of the northern wall is a marble pipe leading toward the west,
and rising upward and then through a marble box-shaped structure standing
upon a tripod of marble legs. The top of the marble box is an iron grate, and
smoke rises from it. The marble pipe exits out the other side and rises up
the northern wall until it disappears through the ceiling. Another pipe runs
across the ceiling and down the northern wall until it finds one of the
murder holes, at which point it turns outward and stops. Water drips from its
open end to the ground below.</pre>
