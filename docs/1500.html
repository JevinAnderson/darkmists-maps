  <h1>At the Fortress Barbican</h1>
  <pre>The Covenant fortress' entrance is wedged between the mountain
stone on the east and west sides with the only passable ways
being north to the fortress ward or south to the Blight.  The
entire fortress was constructed partially within the mountains
for greater defense, and a heavy spiked adamantite portcullis
looms overhead, ready to drop down as a second layer of defense
behind the massive adamantite studded ironwood doors.  A third layer
of defense in the form of another set of studded ironwood doors behind
the portcullis.  In addition to these defenses, a wooden palisade stands
at an angle facing outwards, ready to bring charges to a bloody halt.</pre>
