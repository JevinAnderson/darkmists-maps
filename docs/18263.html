  <h1>The Massive Cavern of the Lady of Purity</h1>
  <pre>Upon the far wall of the cavern, a huge hearth radiates a warm and
cozy heat. The massive fire crackles amiably and sends light
bouncing all over. Above the hearth are two magnificent portraits.
On the left is a massive portrait of Joja wearing hunter-crafted
leathers. On the right is a portrait of Krazar wearing an open-
neck tunic and leathers. Along the north wall, in silver frames
that set them apart from the clay red walls, are six smaller
pictures, labelled with the names, Kalkyr, Burthain, Dalvimyr,
Trevyr, Agharil, and Jyracil. On the western wall beside the
fireplace are two tall pictures, labelled with the names Bludgwuar
and Agryr. A smaller picture between these two is labelled with the
name, Sengeril.</pre>
