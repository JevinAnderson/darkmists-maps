  <h1>The Haunted Pine Forest</h1>
  <pre>The snow begins to fall thickly as you enter a pine forest in the
mountains.  The burnt remains of two log cabins lie in a clearing
about a dozen yards off the path.  There is a disconcerting silence
in these woods, an oppressive lifelessness that makes you want to
leave them immediately.  The trail stretches through these haunted
woods up the side of the mountain and down through the fog to the
foothills of the range.</pre>
