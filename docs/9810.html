    <pre class="room-description">A lavish looking bed is in the center of this room. It is round
and is covered with the furs and hides of exotic animals. It
looks very comfortable. Book shelves line the far wall, taking
up the walls surrounding the bed. The floor is covered with a
thick weaved carpet, looking like it would be fitting to hang
upon the wall of a king's castle as a most cherished tapestry.
A solid oak desk sits in the corner. Resting next to it is a
chair covered with leather and padded with stuffing which looks
much better than the rickety pine chair sitting across from it.</pre>
