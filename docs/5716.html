    <h1>Further into the Keep</h1>
    <pre>
This passage leads further into the keep. Solid stones make up the sturdy
walls of the keep. The floors are polished to a glossy shine. To the east a
Roman arch allows passage to a barracks. To the south you see a lot of
foliage from under the stone arch. Along the base of the wall to the west, a
marble pipe runs north and south. On the walls near the Inner Keep, a number
of human handprints have haphazardly stained the walls with dried blood.</pre
