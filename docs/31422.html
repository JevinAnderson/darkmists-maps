  <h1>Inside the Vledimire Memorial</h1>
  <pre>There is a sense of peace and holiness about this building. The
pristine white marble outside is nothing compared to the marblesque
walls and floor within. They practically glow with a holy aura. For now,
nothing adorns the bright, practically glowing marble walls of this part
of the Memorial. In the center of the room is a pedestal with a book
upon it.</pre>
