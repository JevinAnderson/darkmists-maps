    <h1 class="room-header">The Altar of The Never Ending Crusades</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">You stand in the most sacred room in Castle Balkra. High above polished granite
walls is a nice vaulted ceiling, a dome covered with a mosaic of brilliant
colors depicting the life of the First Crusader, a dwarf who gave his life
and soul to be housed in the Gauntlet. The walls themselves are so shiny they
appear to glow with a luminescence that seems almost alive. Inscribed on the
north and south walls are different parts of page sixteen of the Crusader Book
of the Code. Covering much of the wall behind the altar is a huge painting
depicting a nature scene. The altar itself is fashioned as a pristine block of
granite sitting upon a base of marble, with circular stairs leading up to it.
Inside the altar lies the War Gauntlet which is guarded day and night by the
Wise One. It is rumored that to touch the Gauntlet of War with an impure
warrior's soul is to incur the wrath of the gods of war. The floor is also of
marble, and it is very clean despite the fact that many booted feet that have
trodden upon mud and dirt must enter here at one time or another.</pre>
