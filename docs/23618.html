  <h1>A Wooded Yard</h1>
  <pre>The stronghold opens up in the rear to the wooded area behind. It is so
thick that it is almost impassable and quickly becomes so to the south.
It would be easy for one with knowledge of the woods to hide here. You
may continue through the woods to the west but every other way is
impassable.</pre>
