  <h1>Squire Barracks</h1>
  <pre>Covenant Squires, being the lowest on the ranking ladder, stay
in this barracks when they're not training or being yelled at
by superiors.  The barracks is conveniently located across the
hall from the enlisted knights barracks so the more experienced
knights can keep an eye on the ill trained squires.</pre>
