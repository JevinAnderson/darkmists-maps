  <h1>The Massive Cavern of the Lord of Fear</h1>
  <pre>As you enter this mammoth cave, you are immediately
struck not only by its huge proportions, but also by the
warm moist air that is very fresh and crisp in your lungs.
The smooth walls are a clay red color and are lined with
flickering torches of pure silver. Between each torch
are large shields bearing the Lechium Family Crest. You
notice a large inscription upon the floor.</pre>
