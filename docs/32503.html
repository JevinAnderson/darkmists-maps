  <h1>A lateral shift in the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The descent stops abruptly here and and tunnel instead shoots northward
into a dim looking ethereal chamber.  Everything about this place forces
your gaze further into the depths of the tunnel.  There are ethereal strands
of webbing upon which you might be able to find footing to climb out or
further in.  Loose clumps of dark brown clay occasionally break loose and
come tumbling down the shaft.  A sickeningly sweet smell of old dust and
rosewater is overpowering, adding to the strange sensation of this bizarre
place.</pre>
