  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>To the north of the natural rock path which extends east and
west, is a deep pool fed by the waters from a gurgling stream
flowing beneath a rock bridge to the west-north-west. South of
the natural path, tall trees rise up, their leaves forming a
canopy which cannot extend above the pool. Sunlight therefore
shines upon the water's surface during the day and warms the
surface of the rocks which form the path. Short shrubs grow
between the thick tree trunks, lending foliage to the lower
levels of the forested garden. The rock path is uneven, and
the ground slopes, so that the farther east you travel, the
lower in altitude you become, the farther west, the higher.</pre>
