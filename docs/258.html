  <h1>The Shady bridge</h1>
  <pre>You stand on the eastern end of a finely crafted wooden bridge. Its
edges have small engraved runes carved into them, and the wood
is probably a form of pine or oak from the Emerald Forest itself.
Lacking the dull weathered tone and creaking of most wooden
bridges, it spans across a fairly wide river flowing in a north-south
direction. The height of the surrounding trees provide a pleasant
shade from the noon-day sun.</pre>
