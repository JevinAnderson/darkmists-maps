  <h1>By the herb garden</h1>
  <pre>The rock hard, soil-strewn path extends northward and southward here. On the
west side, you see an herb garden, the herb plants blossoming nicely. Honey
bees buzz about, and sometimes you see one sipping nectar from a nearby
herbal flower. To the east of this path, trees grow, their trunks surrounded
by short shrubs and ground cover plants.</pre>
