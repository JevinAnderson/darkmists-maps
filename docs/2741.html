  <h1>Study</h1>
  <pre>The library to the west is part of this room, but here there is
only a song book, and near a small wooden stool is a large lute.
A cross-stitched bit of cloth framed in oak hangs from the
eastern wall. A large oaken door is to the east, right by that
cross-stitched plaque.</pre>
