    <pre class="room-description">Just to the east of the Glade of Sanctuary is a part of the forest rarely
visited. Tall golden oak trees with thick trunks lend shade to this part
of the Golden Leaf Wood, keeping the harshness of the sun from blanching
the leaves of the tiny trees growing within. A path of hard packed black
dirt winds around, allowing the visitor to view all the plants without
stepping upon any. The ground is otherwise covered with golden oak leaves
which have fallen, lending a fresh carpet to the wood here, and somehow
not wandering onto the path. Animals feel welcome here and often visit,
careful not to trample the little trees. A small section of the garden
is devoted to a few rose plants. You see one rosebush filled with black
roses, fragrant with a heady and sensual scent. The black rose bush is
surrounded by a number of smaller rosebushes bearing tiny pink rosebuds.
Surrounding those plants are a circle of brilliant yellow tulips. A small
sign is planted in the little rose garden.</pre>
