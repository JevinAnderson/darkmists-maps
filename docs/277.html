    <pre class="room-description">Thick green vines form an impossible barrier to the south. There is
no reason to doubt that these vines possess the same ability to
block even the most determined machete-armed lumber-dwarf than all
the others. What does seem a bit strange, however, are faint footsteps
leading up to the vines and abruptly stopping. Could they merely be
tracks from an age past, now lost to the world and found only in time
and memory? Before the green vines is a mound, at the end of which you
see a sword hilt sticking up (the blade fast in the ground). The hilt
glows, and what little bit of the blade is visible between hilt and
ground seems to be flickering with brilliant flames.</pre>
