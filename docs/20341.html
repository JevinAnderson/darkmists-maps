  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>Striated rock walls on either side of you guide you along this north-south
passageway through the stone. Clinging to the walls, naturally glowing lichen
lend light to your passage. The ceiling is high and dark. From the south come
echoing sounds of activity.</pre>
