  <h1>The Forest Road</h1>
  <pre>You are walking a long a north-south road in the forest.  The Greenbrier
bushes that grow beside the path have shed many heart-shaped leaves on
the road.  Two blue-breasted swallows swoop low in front of you, trilling
out a morning song.  The road continues north and south.</pre>
