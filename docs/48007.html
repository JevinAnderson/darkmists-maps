    <pre class="room-description">Not even the floors creak at the top of the staircase, as not one
sound manages to ring out in the oppressive silence.  A single candle
sits in an alcove on the eastern wall, dimly providing you with vision
of this eery room.  Other alcoves are seen on the walls, except that
instead of containing candles, bear statuettes of the gods of Syndicate.
The alcoves contain images of Rellion, Jeriath, Krazar, and Joja peering
down at those present on the landing with suspicious eyes.  As opposed
to the filthy lower level, this landing is well kept, with no evidence
of grime or disease anywhere.  To the west is a huge, double door made
from the finest ebony wood, bearing the emblem of the Syndicate gilded
masterfully.  A dangerous looking set of stairs lead back to the first
floor.</pre>
