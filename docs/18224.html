  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock paths converge here, stretching to east and
west, as well as southward. Thin trunked trees rise, their
bark smooth and grey except where it peels, naturally, from
the trunk. These trees have not a thick canopy of foliage, but
thin, intermittant shade, allowing the sunlight to filter in
through the leaves during the day. Thick, large-leaved shrubs
grow between the tree trunks, and huge-leafed ivy covers the
ground. A large slab of stone spans a stream of water that
gurgles its way to the east.</pre>
