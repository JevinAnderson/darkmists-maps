  <h1>The Battle Room</h2>
  <pre>This is what is known as the battle room. A rack filled with wooden practice
weapons greets you as you enter. A circular open pit forms a battle arena in
which the monk and gladiator instruct from. Stains of sweat and dried blood
lay scattered about the pit and the heavy scent of salt hang in the air.
Battle charts and graphs of weak points of different races line the walls.
Dummies, many which seem beaten to a pulp, already lie scattered about. This
seems to be the perfect place for a warrior to build and tone the skills of
combat.</pre>
