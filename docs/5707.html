This is the far eastern side of the keep. As with the rest of Castle Balkra,
the craftsmanship of stone here is the finest in the land. Torches hung to
the solid stone walls cast a creepy shadow as you make your way through this
room. The stone keep seems to offer little comfort as a chill of cool air
blows through the hall. To the west, east, and south a large Roman arch leads
to other parts of the castle. Along the floor to the west, a marble pipe runs
north and south, and at the northern wall turns toward the east, running
along the base of the wall.</pre
