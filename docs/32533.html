  <h1>Within a Strange Chamber</h1>
  <pre>In the distance you make out a wide variety of strange hunched figures
floating about a large open chamber without any regard for your presence.
The walls of this place shimmer and hum with an intense psionic energy,
acting more as mental barriers than physical ones.  It is almost as if
the architect of this place used sheer imagination and mental will to
construct the form of this area.</pre>
