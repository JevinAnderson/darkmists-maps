  <h1>Within the cave</h1>
  <pre>The surrounding walls and ceiling are made of solid limestone rock and
curve naturally towards the center; their surfaces are mostly smooth
except for some rough patches where algae has grown in sporadic spots,
giving the cave-wall a dull, almost sickly-green coloration.  The ground
here is flat but slopes slightly such that keeping one's balance and
going forward with ease could become problematic for most creatures.
Water droplets splatter from the ceiling to the lower reaches and finally
unto the floor beneath, making the traverse more difficult.  Some beaten
tracks of a four-legged animal could be seen here going further southwards.
An occasional arthropod saunters about.  It is unusually quiet.</pre>
