  <h1>Portal Room</h1>
  <pre>This room is used mainly by the Covert Operations as a way of
inserting soldiers into strategic places throughout Thera.  The
entire room is marked with holy symbols and runes, each glowing
with power.  The way north leads to the hallway and an inscription
is carved on the floor around a portal.</pre>
