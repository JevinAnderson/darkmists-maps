  <h1>A Secluded Corner of the Meadow</h1>
  <pre>You are in a quiet corner of the meadow, well-shaded by two large cypress
trees.  Though empty now, it seems a likely spot for young couples to
exchange professions of love, undisturbed by friends or irate parents.
Having no time for such adolescent frivolities, you quickly scan the
countryside and note that from this vantage point, you can look over the
entire village of Clover.  There is a small lightly worn path leading to
the south.</pre>
