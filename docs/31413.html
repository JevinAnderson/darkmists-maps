  <h1>A Turn in the Well-Kept Path</h1>
  <pre>A path of flat white stones leads south and west. To either side
of the path are colorful wildflowers in low-trimmed lawn. To the
east is a pristine marble building. In bas-relief next to the door
is a figure of a paladin knight with what appears to be a Thera Ball
under one arm, while his other arm, or rather hand, wields a sword.
The door is closed, but it does not appear locked. Above the door
is a golden plaque with two names upon it. Above, you read,
'VLEDIMIRE' and below it, 'RENARD LAMONT SMITH'.</pre>
