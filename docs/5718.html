  <h1>The Green Room</h2>
  <pre>A cool mist and the sound of splashing water greets you as you enter this
part of the keep. It seems the Crusaders planted a miniature forest inside
their castle! For a moment it is hard to tell whether you stand inside or out
until you catch sight of the large stone ceiling arching overhead. Small
oaks, pines, vines, bushes, and flowers of all sorts thrive here. A marble
fountain squirts cool water in the center of the tranquil room. Suddenly, you
notice a figure blended in with the natural colors, eyeing your every move.
Near one of the bushes is a mound and a marker.</pre>
