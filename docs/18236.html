  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path turns toward the west and south here,
encircling a miniature forest garden. To the north and east,
cracked boulders serve as a perch for a number of small but
weather-hardy pine and fir trees whose trunks have been blown
in different directions over time, resulting in some rather
twisted shapes. They remain alive, however, and cling to life,
ever green. To the southwest, the ground is covered with moss
and grasses, and the small trees growing there are deciduous,
their branches following the will of the seasons, with leaves
budding, growing, turning darker green, then to brilliant golds
and scarlets, and then, brittle brown, falling to the ground
and leaving bare branches to rustle in the winter winds. In
miniature, these trees are exquisite, regardless of the season.</pre>
