  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path stretches toward the north and
south. Along the east and west sides of the bank, thin
trunked trees rise up, their bark smooth and grey except
where nature has chosen to peel it away in paper thin
peelings. These trees were graced with a thin canopy
which allows the sun to filter through. Intermittant
shade dances upon the large (about five inches across)
leafed ivy which covers the ground. Along the west side
of the path, a flowerbed stretches north and south, the
ivy making attempts to crawl over the boundaries. Along
the east side, a stream of water gurgles northward.</pre>
