  <h1>Southern viewpoint</h1>
  <pre>The rock-hard path begins here, or ends here, depending on your point of
view. The designers of the natural city chose not to extend it farther into
the natural woodland to the west, which grows unhindered by mortal civiliza-
tion. As a result you find yourself gazing upon pure natural beauty. You hear
a constant roar from the south. Looking to the south, you see a breathtaking
view of a natural waterfall. A river flows east and west, from high ground
to the west to considerably lower ground to the east. The spray of the water
occasionally blows up toward you, cooling your face. A fence of striated
zebrawood prevents the foolhardy from venturing further south and taking a
suicidal leap into the river far below, while serving as a fine place to
lean, relax, and enjoy the view.</pre>
