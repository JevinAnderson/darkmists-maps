  <h1>The Final Defense</h1>
  <pre>The walls in this room are reinforced by strong dwarvish steel, but this
steel was not strong enough to withstand the wrath of the Goddess of Magic.
A single torch hangs over the passage to the east, giving the room a darkened
appearance. The charred remains of something covering the mangled walls does
not lend any extra light.  Crusaders often use this as an ambush point to
subdue those raiding to steal the War Gauntlet.</pre>
