  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path leads in three directions here. From the west you hear the
sounds of activity. Northward, you sense a difference in the light within the
tunnel, for it is a little different from the soft glow of the lichen which
lends its natural light to the underground here, clinging to striated stone
walls. To the east, the path seems to stretch for a long way.</pre>
