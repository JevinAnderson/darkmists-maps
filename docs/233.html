  <h1>A Well-Used Trail Through The Forest</h1>
  <pre>You are on a forest trail that runs in all directions but north, where
the forest skirts the sheer mountain face.  Dew-covered hawthorn bushes
flank the east trail, along which several rangers are walking.  It seems
to be the woodkeepers' outpost.</pre>
