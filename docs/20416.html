  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>A dark canopy of green leaves arches over the hard, soil-strewn path beneath
you. To the east thick woods and lush, berry-rich bushes grow unhindered. The
path forks to the west and extends northward and southward. Little plants
line the hard path, their light green leaves and pink blossoms lending a
little color to the darkness. You hear the buzzing of honey bees, but only
occasionally do you see one sipping nectar from the pink flowers at the edges
of the path.</pre>
