  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>Westward toward a widening in the cavern, eastward straight on for a while,
the stony pathway stretches, its north and south walls, striated in grey and
brown, lit by naturally glowing lichen clinging to the rock. The ground
beneath, and the high ceiling above, are both dark. From the east you hear
the sounds of activity.</pre>
