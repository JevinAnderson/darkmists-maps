  <h1>Inside the Cedric Lightshield Memorial</h1>
  <pre>There is a sense of peace and holiness about this building. The
pristine white marble outside is nothing compared to the marblesque
walls and floor within. They practically glow with a holy aura.
On the north wall is a portrait of Cedric Lightshield. In the
middle of the room is a pedestal bearing a white book.</pre>
