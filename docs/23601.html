    <pre class="room-description">Many of the rooms have been transported brick by brick from the
previous Stronghold building but some changes have been made as well.
Widely spaced walls of white marble border a spacious hallway leading
north and south. An arched ceiling overhead is supported by many slender,
intricately carved pillars, and it echoes the sound of running water
coming from the south. The floor is made of the same grey stone that
composes the pillars, and is mostly unremarkable, though it is
interrupted just inside the door by a huge and intricate mosaic. The jet-
black opal on one side seems to struggle against the pearl of purest
white on the other, but there is harmony in their balance as well. A
chamber opens southward and massive wooden doors are set in the thick
walls to the north, allowing exit from the Justicar fortress.</pre>
