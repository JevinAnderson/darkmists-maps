    <pre class="room-description">You have finally made your way through the winding streets of Ofcol, and
find yourself here, before the legendary Citadel of Justice, home to the
Enforcers of Law.  The Citadel is an enormous construct, towering over the
city.  The citadel is a fortified castle, with three large cylindrical
towers jutting out above the main building.  A small river runs here past
the road leading up to the main gates, which requires a drawbridge to cross.
The drawbridge is currently raised and you are standing just inside of it,
before the Main Gateway of the Citadel.  The drawbridge is lowered, oddly
allowing you free access to this supposedly "closed" house.</pre>
