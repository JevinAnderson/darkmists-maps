  <h1>On a path</h1>
  <pre>The path here leads westward, northward, and eastward. It is hard stone,
liberally covered with soil, from which the occasional blade of grass or
leafy ground cover sort of plant attempts to grow. To the south is a forest,
through which the city designers chose not to extend the pathway. The trees
there grow unhindered. To the northwest is a garden of herbs and spices.</pre>
