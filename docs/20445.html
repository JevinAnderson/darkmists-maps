The hard rock path is strewn liberally with soil. It stretches toward the
north and south. High trees lend a dark canopy cover to keep it well shaded.
A few lush green bushes grow here, their leafy branches somehow well tended.
To the north and south the path stretches on through the woodland tunnel. At
the edges of the path are plants growing low to the ground, with bright
green leaves and soft orange and white blooms about the diameter of a human
thumbnail. Just beyond them are low growing shrubs bearing sweet berries. A
sweet scent fills the air here, and the sound of buzzing alerts you to the
presence of busy honey bees. Once in a while you see one sipping nectar from
the little orange and white flowers.</pre
