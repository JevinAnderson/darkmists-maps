  <h1>The Ragged Trail</h1>
  <pre>You stand on a ragged forest trail with passage leading in all four
directions. The pathways to the north, south and east lead deeper
into the woods, while a winding trail west seems to end in a small
clearing. From where you stand you can see small movement and
curious sound which you can't quite make out. The tree branches
sway softly while you decide your next course.</pre>
