  <h1>A Charred Platform</h1>
  <pre>The platform you stand on is a circular manifestation that runs
around the sides of this cylindrical chamber. There is a huge gap
in the center of the floor, giving way to a ledge that runs around
a huge totem in the center of the room. The ledge gradually spirals
downward, leading through the center of this abyss. The totem is a
horrific pillar - it is as a pile of corpses, thrown haphazardly
upon the other. It is rendered in horrid detail, so that every
expression, every position, every aspect of death - all are contained.
The pillar serves as some sort of stairway, allowing one to venture
downward, deeper within, or upward, freedom from this hellish venue.
A veil of darkness covers the room, a perpetual black that the strongest
lights cannot vanquish fully.  The shadows cover stones around you,
climbing upwards, straining to overwhelm the little light that
reaches down into the cavern. The veil gives way to your east and west,
seething openings that waver in the heat.</pre>
