  <h1>The Smithy of the Crusades</h1>
  <pre>You might think that the extreme heat of the huge forge and the vats of
molten steel could withstand the wrath of the Goddess, but instead you
note that the fires are out, and the vat solid rock. Indeed, the walls
are cracked, as though struck with extreme cold. The forge itself is
cracked. Rubble is strewn everywhere on the ground. You touch a metal
blade on the floor, it shatters, weakened by a force unknown to mortals.</pre>
