    <pre class="room-description">You stand at the only entrance to House Crusader.  The walls have been
carved from the solid earth by divine power.  Located deep underground,
it was constructed by Lord Julive after the original keep was destroyed.
However, as long as it lasted since then, it was no match for the wrath
of Lady Xyza who blasted it with her immortal magic after the gods of
this House attacked hers. The rest of the Keep, what is left of it, is
to the east. Druvka's ruined house is to the west.</pre>
