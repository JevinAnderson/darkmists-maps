  <h1>A Well-Kept Path</h1>
  <pre>A path of flat white stones leads west. To either side
of the path are colorful wildflowers in low-trimmed lawn. To
the east is a pristine marble building. In bas-relief next
to the door is the figure of a scribe with a feathered pen
writing a tome. The expression on the scribe's face appears
to be that of inspired joy. The door to the building is
closed, but it does not appear to be locked. Above this door
is a golden plaque bearing two names. The one above reads,
'ILPHRYNN DARMO'CHE' and the one below reads, 'PATRICK
WILLIAM LYNCH'.</pre>
