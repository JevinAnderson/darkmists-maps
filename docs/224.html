  <h1>The Cavern of the Witch Sisters</h1>
  <pre>This is the abode of the Witch Sisters.  Gibbets hang from the ceiling,
scrying pools lie placid while cauldrons gurgle awfully.  From a large
rift in the ground infernal flames belch forth.  The heat in the cavern
is almost unbearable and you begin to feel yourself passing out from
the oppressive stench of brimstone.</pre>
