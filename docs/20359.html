  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>You are standing at a T-intersection which branches to the north, south, and
east. From the east and south you hear some sounds of activity. Naturally
glowing lichen cling to the striated walls here, lending light to the
passageway. The floor and the high ceiling are both dark.</pre>
