  <h1>On a path</h1>
  <pre>The rock-hard, soil-strewn path here leads east and west. Toward the west are
tall trees left to grow unhindered. From the east you hear sounds of fighting
and grunting. A wooden sign is planted in the ground near the edge of the
path toward the east. The atmosphere is thick with the scent of green leaves.
Toward the south is a small but sturdy cottage. A neat path leads through the
trees to the open front door.</pre>
