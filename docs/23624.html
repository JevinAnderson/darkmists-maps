  <h1>Main Gateway of the Citadel</h1>
  <pre>Standing here within the gateway into the main courtyard and building of
the citadel, you can't help but be overtaken with a feeling of complete
awe.  The building rises straight up before you and is topped with ramparts
and walkways that once allowed Enforcer guards to keep vigilant watch over
any who entered or left the edifice.  A portcullis looms above the gate,
waiting to be dropped should the need arise. A small guardpost stands just
within the gates.</pre>
