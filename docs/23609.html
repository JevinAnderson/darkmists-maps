  <h1>Council of the Justicars</h1>
  <pre>A smooth floor of grey marble supports the massive oaken table that
dominates this room, its polished surface gleaming in the flickering
light of the torches mounted along the walls. A single chair stands at
the head of the long table, intended for the High Arbiter of the
Justicars to preside over the meetings that take place here. Most
striking in this room, however, are the two statues mounted on the
northern and southern walls. The two avian figures oversee the
deliberations with outstretched wings and gleaming eyes- one a bright
phoenix, the other a dark owl. A door offers exit to the west.</pre>
