  <h1>Within the Halls of Valor</h1>
  <pre>The halls of the castle are simple yet elegant.  A finely woven blue
carpet runs down the middle of the walkway.  Small crosses in a darker
hue of blue are sewn into the carpet at equal intervals.  Beautiful
white marble tile can be seen to either side of the carpet.  Torches
are lit along the hallway giving off a flickering illumination.  A
masterfully crafted tower shield is mounted on the Northern wall.
Below it a sign can be seen with the simple word of "Courage" engraved
upon it.</pre>
