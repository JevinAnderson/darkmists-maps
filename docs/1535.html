  <h1>Underground Farm</h1>
  <pre>This underground farm supplements the Covenant food supply.
The illusion of a sky and the real weather that affects the Ranger
Corps' recreation room also affects this small farm where rangers
grow crops and tend to poultry coops and a small herd of cows
and sheep and a sty of pigs.  A small sheepdog can be seen running
around herding the sheep and cows away from the Ranger Corps'
recreation room.</pre>
