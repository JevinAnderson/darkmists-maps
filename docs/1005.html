The Sanctum of the Brethren, the link to the Underworld, the Solace
of Darkness. This room is utterly black, wholly consumed by the
shadow, save for one image that is thrust upon you, burned into
your brain. It is the Gate of Hell, the field of energy that
will be Thera's ultimate demise. This is the main gate, it cannot
be destroyed - its power can be reduced, but it is here, permanently.
The Gate draws your gaze, a plethora of images within. When your
eyes light upon it, energy pulses through you. It is not a pleasant
feeling, for it creeps within you, touching you, within. It invades
your privacy, pulls your soul, and makes you feel unclean. Within
this portal resides your nightmares, your hates, your guilty desires,
and, possibly most intense of all, your mortal fears. Though the
cavern beyond has long been abandoned, this room seems as if it has
never been altered by mortal hands, a constant reminder of the
inhabitants who once called this tortured place home.</pre
