  <h1>The Cokery</h1>
  <pre>A stone counter separates the cooking area from the common area in this
underground shop of pastries and other dessert delights. It appears to
have been formed from several blocks of stone imported from outside this
area. The counter top is smooth, and each block fits next to its neighbor
perfectly. On the grey and brown striated wall behind the counter is a
wooden sign. A pit kept hot with burning wood keeps the cubic iron oven
hanging above it hot enough for baking, but not hot enough to burn the
pastries cooked within. Softly glowing lichen streak across the walls
far from the hot pit and iron oven, lending some light to this sweetly
fragrant shop.</pre>
