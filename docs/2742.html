  <h1>Sitting Room</h1>
  <pre>Perhaps this room would be better described as a spinning and
weaving room. In the southwest corner is a spinning wheel, next
to which are spools of thread and piles of flax. By the southern
wall is a medium-sized loom. The Lady of the Manor is apparently
an excellent spinner and weaver. Draped over one chair is a
flaxen tunic, its material soft to the touch.</pre>
