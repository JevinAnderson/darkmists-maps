  <h1>Mind Trap</h1>
  <pre>You have mistakenly wandered into one of the hive's many mind traps, designed
to mislead and entrap unwelcome visitors to the hive lair.  There appears to
be no way out, though perhaps death will save you.  You have little time to
wallow in your confusion and despair, as the hive's "cleaning" robot appears
to have been dispatched to end your brief visit.</pre>
