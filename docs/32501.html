  <h1>A strange tunnel carved into the earth</h1>
  <pre>Everything about this place forces your gaze deeper down into the depths
of the tunnel.  There are ethereal strands of webbing upon which you might
be able to find footing.  Loose clumps of dark brown clay occasionally break
loose and come tumbling down the shaft.  A sickeningly sweet smell of old
dust and rosewater is overpowering, adding to the strange sensation of
this bizarre place.
You may want to take your time, as a slip in here could mean death.</pre>
