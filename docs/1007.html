  <h1>Upon the Red Stair</h1>
  <pre>You are upon a stair of dull red rock, a short passage, but one
that draws your eye. Black sigils have been pressed into the smooth
stone, written in the tongue of the Underworld. An orb of swirling
quicksilver rests upon the floor to either side of the stair. The
clear orb reveals the turbulence of the liquid metal contained within.
Above your head, the ceiling slopes downward, the smooth obsidian
glowing in the flickering of torchlight. The torchlight emanates from
braziers, lit upon each step. Deep claw marks mar the black glass,
otherwise clean, smooth. Random scrawls, as though some powerful
beast had been released, and attacked the very structure around it.
Upward, a twisted tower can be observed on a raised dais. Downward
lies a landing, the lower halls of the Ahzra In'trea.</pre>
