  <h1>High Altar of the Conclave of Wizardry</h1>
  <pre>You can barely stand to be here.  The force of the power contained here is
almost too much for you to bear.  The eastern wall is curved, and covered in a
row of windows that overlook all the lands of Thera.  Standing in the center
of this wall is a statue of the Lord of Magic, Riallus.  It is made of
pristine marble and is so extraordinarily detailed that you think it might
come to life.  In his left hand he holds a replica of his staff.  His right
hand is held to his heart and is clasping something.  You are unable to see
what it is, but it shines so brilliantly that light streams from between the
fingers of the statue and plays all over the room.  This is the heart of the
tower, and truly a divine sanctuary.</pre>
