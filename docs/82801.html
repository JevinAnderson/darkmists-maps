  <h1>The Gates of the Castle</h1>
  <pre>Swung wide open the gates of this castle stand nearly 20 feet tall.
Made of solid wood, they are polished to perfection.  A large crossbeam
sits suspended from the rampart above, ready to be lowered into place
should the gates be closed.  The halls of the castle can be seen to
the North.  The marble floors shine on either side of the blue carpet
that runs down the center of the walkway.  A large shield engraved
with a blue cross hangs on the front of both gates.  Directly over head
a blue cross sits in a prominent position over the gates.</pre>
