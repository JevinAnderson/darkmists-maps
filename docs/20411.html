  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>A dark canopy of green leaves arches over the hard, soil-strewn path beneath
you. To the west are thick woods and lush, berry-rich bushes growing unhin-
dered. The path forks to the east and extends northward and southward. Little
plants line the hard path, their light green leaves and blossoms of golden
yellow lending a little color to the darkness. You hear the buzzing of honey
bees, but only occasionally do you see one sipping nectar from the blossoms
at the edges of the path.</pre>
