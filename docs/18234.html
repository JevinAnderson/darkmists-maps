    <pre class="room-description">The natural rock paths converge here, stretching to east and
west, as well as southward. During the day the sun is bright
here, for all the trees are in miniature, and no canopy of
thick leaves offers any shade. To the north of the path,
there are many rocks, and the small trees growing here cling
to those rocks with weather-toughened roots. Their trunks
have twisted and turned with the wind, some cascading, others
just leaning. Most of the trees here are from the pine and fir
families. Their bark is as tough as their will to live.</pre>
