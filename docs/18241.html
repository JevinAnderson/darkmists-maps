  <h1>The end of the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path extends to the north from here,
leading toward a path encircling a miniature forest
garden of deciduous trees amid grasses and moss. To
the south is a well-kept flowerbed. To the east and
the west of the path, a few fern trees grow amidst
small bushes with tiny, brilliant red roses blooming
within thorny cages. A bench is here for resting and
enjoying the view of the miniature garden to the north-
north-east.</pre>
