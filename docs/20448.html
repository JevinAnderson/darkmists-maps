  <h1>Shrine to Krazar</h1>
  <pre>Within the huge stump darkness pervades, but for a large hole about twenty
feet up the south side. You look up and barely see what could be called a
ceiling, near the top of the giant stump. Little footfalls and chittering
reaches your ears: A colony of chipmunks has made this stump their home. Bits
of grass and nut shell litter the floor in places.</pre>
