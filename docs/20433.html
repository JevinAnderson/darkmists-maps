  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>The hard rock path strewn liberally with soil stretches toward the north and
south. High trees lend a canopy cover to keep it well shaded. A few lush
green bushes grow here, their branches somehow well tended. To the north and
south the path merely stretches on through the woodland tunnel. At the edges
of the path are low to the ground plants, with bright green leaves and soft
orange and white blooms about the diameter of a human thumbnail. Just beyond
them are low growing shrubs bearing sweet berries. A sweet scent fills the
air here, and the sound of buzzing alerts you to the presence of honey bees.
Once in a while you see one sipping nectar from the little orange and white
flowers.</pre>
