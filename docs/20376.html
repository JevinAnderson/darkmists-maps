  <h1>Barr's Bar</h1>
  <pre>The smell of authenticity welcomes you as you enter this place.  The unique
fragrance of blended herbs and spices brings your senses to a certain bliss.
The tavern is dimly illuminated from the candles and oil lamps in all
corners. The central bar counter, with its stools, seems to have been taken
from similar rock to that of the surrounding cavern, but unhewn, a counter
formed by nature.</pre>
