  <h1>On a path by an herb garden</h1>
  <pre>The path beneath you is of hard stone covered liberally with soil. Depending
on your point of view, the path either ends or begins here. To your north is
a vast garden of herbs and spices. To the west and south is forest, not so
much impenetrable as those who designed this natural city did not wish to
extend the path farther in, thus giving the trees peace to grow unhindered.
Yet a path seems to have formed here, a dirt path unplanned, and the trees and
shrubs part grudgingly to allow passage to the south.</pre>
