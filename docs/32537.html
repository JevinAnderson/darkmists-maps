  <h1>Within the Strange Chamber</h1>
  <pre>All around you, strange hunched figures regard you with a mixture of disdain
and contempt before continuing about their business.  The beings are dark and
covered in tattered rags, as the physical realm means little to them. The walls
of this place shimmer and hum with an intense psionic energy, acting more as
mental barriers than physical ones.  It is almost as if the architect of this
place used sheer imagination and mental will to construct the form of this
area.</pre>
