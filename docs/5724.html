    <h1>The Southwest Tower</h1>
    <pre>
A howling whistle of wind and the draft of cool air welcomes you as you enter
the southwest tower of the castle. Strong granite stones masoned with excep-
tional skill form the cone that makes up the tower. Tall stairs lead upwards,
each step just below an average human's knee spiral to the top. Along the
tower walls murder holes give a field of observation to that side of the
castle. Green moss grows between the goves of the fine stone. A damp cool
breeze of air blows through the tower. Hanging on the stone wall, visible to
all who look, is a small sign carved from redwood.</pre
