    <pre class="room-description">A huge mass of red oak forms a circle table that takes up half of the room.
Oversized solid oak chairs with tall backs line the edge of the giant table.
One chair dwarfs the rest, its size large enough for a titan to sit in.
Battle maps and charts are pinned to various points of the walls. This seems
to be the room where many of the important decisions take place. Near one of
the many maps on the wall is a framed leather scroll. Below it is a second
framed leather scroll, this one sealed with green and adorned with a green
ribbon. In one corner is a rock bearing the likenesses of a centaur, a dwarf,
and a canine which strongly resembles a wolf. There are small words chiseled
in the bottom corner of the rock.</pre>
