  <h1>Bridge Over the River</h1>
  <pre>A sturdy bridge made of rock and mortar extends over the river.
As you cross it, you see masons putting finishing touches on the
bridge. Although it is a fairly new bridge, there are clumps of
dirt and stray stones to show where feet have trodden. The bridge
extends north and south. To the south is a path leading to a water
well, and to the north, a path leading to an archway which appears
to lead into an area being worked by gardeners.</pre>
