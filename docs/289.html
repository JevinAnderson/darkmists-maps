  <h1>The Chapel of Saint Sebastian</h1>
  <pre>You stand within the only standing structure of the once proud Monastery.
Evidently the chapel is looked after for the floors are swept, pews wiped
and the stained-glass windows in good working order. A modest pulpit
made of mahogany with a carved pine cross attached to it faces a few rows
of wooden benches. Probably cared for by questing paladins or clerics
on a pilgrimage, you wonder if any of the faithful might be nearby. To
the west wall you see a hole large enough for you to squeeze through.</pre>
