  <h1>Further in the Keep</h2>
  <pre>This hall carries you further ino Castle Balkra. Each step sounds off a deep
echo carried through the heavy stone halls. To the east under a large Roman
arch lies a large barracks. To the north one can make their way further to
the east side of the castle. Along the base of the wall to the west, there is
a marble pipe stretching toward the north and south. Both east and west walls
near the Inner Keep are covered with haphazardly spaced human hand prints in
dried blood.

A proclamation entitled WAR AGREEMENT hangs on the eastern wall.</pre>
