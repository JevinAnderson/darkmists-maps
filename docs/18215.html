    <pre class="room-description">The natural rock path veers toward the north and east here,
encircling a lovely huge pool to the northeast. To the north,
a rock bridge spans over a stream which forms a small waterfall
as it plunges its waters into the pool below. There is no safe
way down to the pool from here. A break in the canopy of leaves
allows the sun to shine brightly during the day, tickling the
pool's surface with its warm rays and heating the stones of
the natural path. To the west and south, tall trees rise up,
their bark rough, their trunks thick. Shrubs reach out with
thorny branches, temptingly brilliant flowers peeking out from
within thorn-infested cages.</pre>
