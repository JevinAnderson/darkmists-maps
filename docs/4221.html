  <h1>Within a Charred Tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The subterranean tunnel that has been excavated in the earth here appears as
though it was created through otherworldly means.  The walls are scorched and
etched, in some places even glassy looking as the ground has crystallized into
obsidian from some unknown force.  Everything is hot to the touch, and acrid
sulfuric fume wisps waft from every surface.  Strange and disturbing looking
insects you have never seen before scurry about in search of a fresh and hot
meal. The sight if them is enough to turn your stomach. Your vision is then
directed in two places: back toward a burning archway and deeper into the
tunnel, where it abruptly ends in a cave filled with strange and evil totems.</pre>
