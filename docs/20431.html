  <h1>By the herb garden</h1>
  <pre>The path curves here, extending toward the north and the west. To the north-
west is a pretty herb garden, the herbs flowering prettily, and honey bees
buzzing throughout. Along the soil-strewn path toward the north is the garden
to the west, and a crystalline, blue pond to the east. The path to the west
leads straight into the garden.</pre>
