  <h1>Chaplain Corps Recreation Room</h1>
  <pre>The Chaplain Corps, being the most reclusive Covenant branch
aside from the Covert Operations Ghosts, enjoys being close to
the heavens.  This recreation room was built next to the shrine
so they could feel close to the heavens without hogging all the
space in the shrine.  Soft cushions, prayerbooks of several faiths,
and manuscripts of healing and warfare lie in neat little piles
in several locations around the room and the smell of burning
incense gives the room a relaxing atmosphere.</pre>
