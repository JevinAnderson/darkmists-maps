  <h1>Foyer to the Altar Room</h2>
  <pre>The Roman arches continue from the Inner Keep, gracefully overlooking this
quiet spot. The granite floor below has been polished to near mirror shine.
Suits of armor decorate the north and south walls, and in between those suits
a colorful shield representing a family which has given several generations
of honorable warriors to the service of the Crusade. They are colorful, but
most are badly dented and one shows signs of scorching. The walls near the
Inner Keep are covered with haphazard blood stains in the shape of human
hands, some overlapping.</pre>
