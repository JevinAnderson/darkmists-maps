    <pre class="room-description">Covenant squires are an undisciplined lot, prone to arguing with
each other or otherwise bothering each other if left alone too
long.  Their master knights always need to keep an eye on them,
but still give them a bit of privacy, so this barracks was built.
Located right across the hall from the Squire Barracks, the Knights
can rest here yet be close enough to storm the squire barracks
and whap unruly squires if the need arises.  The bunks and furniture
in here look to be more expensive than that of the Squire Barracks.
A painting poster has been stuck to the wall.</pre>
