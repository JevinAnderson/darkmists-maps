  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock paths converge at this point, encircling
the deep pool of water to the southwest and also heading
out to the east. Tall trees growing north of the path lend
shade from their canopy of leaves, but this shade only
extends to the path. The waters of the pool receive full
sunlight on a sunny day. The path slopes upward toward
the south, and also upward toward the west, but levels off
toward the east. Looking toward the southwest, across the
pool, you see a stone bridge across a stream which descends
past a rocky outcropping into the waters below.</pre>
