  <h1>A Break in the Sea of Sands</h1>
  <pre>Finally! You have managed to see something in this vast wasteland
of sand. Off to the west, through the shimmering heat of the sand,
you see something other than sand. But whatever it is, it is too
far away to be identifiable. But whatever it is, it is something
you can focus on and use as a marker in this endless sea of sand.</pre>
