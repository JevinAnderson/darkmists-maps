  <h1>Dark Research Room</h1>
  <pre>The floor is formed of dark mahogany panels, arranged in a pretty parquet
design. The dark walls, of the same wood, gleam in the light. Sconces of
polished brass are set in regular intervals along the walls, thirteen in
number. Each holds a black candle. The doorway remains open, leading to
the east. A shiny silver plaque framed in obsidian hangs on the western
wall.</pre>
