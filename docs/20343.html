  <h1>Bank of Thera</h1>
  <pre>The first thing you notice when you enter this branch of the Bank of Thera is
the row and column panel covering the back wall, west of you. There are a
number of squares set in rows and columns on a panel of shimmering mithril.
Sconces on tripod stands hold flaming torches. In the light of their flames,
a smooth, striated stone counter gleams, its brown and grey surface smooth.
The walls and ceiling are of the same polished, striated stone. Just to the
north of the counter is a marble statue, its alabaster hue in contrast with
the natural stone surroundings.</pre>
