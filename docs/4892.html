    <pre class="room-description">The floor is of obsidian and alabastar mosaic, held together with mortar and
polished to a shine. The circular walls are of smoothly polished obsidian,
the black and white dancing with each other in natural design. A huge former
fountain sits in the center of the floor. It is dry; no liquid flows within
it. A sign carved of light wood hangs on the new wall. Newly polished silver
sconces stand at either side of the sign and continue around the room in
regular intervals. These sconces hold glass containers which, in turn, hold
candles. There are thirteen in total around the perimeter of the room.
An obsidian staircase leads upward. It appears to be in good shape. You see
the glint of gold while looking downward, a golden stair, also in surpris-
ingly good shape.</pre>
