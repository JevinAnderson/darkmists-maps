  <h1>On a Path in the Oasis</h1>
  <pre>You stand within the oasis with life flourishing all around. Dates and
figs hang ripe from the trees while colorful birds chirp away on the
branches. Ferns, scrub brushes, and hearty tall grass is all around you.
Evidence of humanity is everywhere. Clothes dripping from makeshift
clothing lines while baskets of woven hemp scattered here and there
filled with all manners of items. Sounds of people laughing and shouting
can be heard coming from the west. To the west you see the source of
incredible life saving oasis, a huge placid pond. To the north and south
there are openings leading into the cool shade of medium sized tents.</pre>
