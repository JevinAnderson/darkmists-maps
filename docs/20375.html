  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path branches off to the north, east, and west. Softly glowing
lichen clinging to the striated walls lend light to the passageway, and you
hear the sounds of activity coming from the east. High above you, the ceiling
is dark. From the east you hear some noise, and your olfactory nerves detect
the pleasant aroma of herbs and spices. A shingle hangs on silvery mithril
chains extending from the high ceiling.</pre>
