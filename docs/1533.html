    <pre class="room-description">Nestled above the training room inside the mountain, this "tower"
isn't a tower at all since the entire fortress is built into
the mountain.  A series of powerful ballistae mounted on rotating
platforms are arranged on sliding rails, each one ready to fire
at foes outside.  The side of the mountain they are pointing
at has been completely carved out, making this room a bit drafty
but allowing for the ballistae and also archers to fire outside.
Large canvas bags filled with sand and small rocks lie in orderly
piles beside racks of bows and crossbows, barrels of filled quivers
and bolt boxes, ballista bolts, and ballista accessories.</pre>
