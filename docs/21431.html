    <pre class="room-description">Darkness... You are surrounded by darkness... It seems so peaceful here. So
peaceful and dark... Everything is dark, everything... It seems so peaceful,
so dark. You sense, however, that you are not alone. At the periphery of your
mind, you hear whispers. You cannot make out what they are saying, but you
hear them... and they seem disturbing. They interrupt your own thoughts and
break your own inner peace.  As your eyes grow used to the darkness, you look
around you, and you make out claw marks on the hard stone floor.  Your eyes
also see dark on dark, something dark upon the dark claw-marked floor...
something you cannot identify.  Upon that dark something, larvae are feasting.
The peace you felt is disturbed again. Perhaps you can get away, perhaps the
disturbance will be less if you move over there...</pre>
