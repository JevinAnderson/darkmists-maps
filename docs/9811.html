  <h1>Narrow Hallway</h1>
  <pre>This hallway is a little more than a walk-in closet. A human can
stand in the center of the hallway and reach out and touch both
walls. The only light in this hallway comes from the open hall
to the east and from the stairway at the end of the hall. The
stairs are very steep; one would want to be cautious when going
down them.</pre>
