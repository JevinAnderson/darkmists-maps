  <h1>On a path</h1>
  <pre>The path extends north and south, with a turn-off toward the east. Rock-hard,
strewn with soil, it seems destined to be a battleground between stomping
feet and small plants seeking to grow beyond their safe limits. The atmosphere
is fresh and clean here, thick with the smell of a healthy forest.</pre>
