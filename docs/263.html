  <h1>The Emerald Forest Choir</h1>
  <pre>Pushing aside a tangle of falling vines, you find yourself on a trail
deep in an unexplored area of the Emerald Forest.  Passage to the north
and south are blocked by clustered thickets of sagebrush and rosemary.
The cheerful croaking of a tree-frog catches your eat, accompanied by
the soprano trill of a swallow and an acapella team of bush insects.
The trail allows travel to the east and west.</pre>
