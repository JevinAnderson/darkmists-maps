  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path extends north and south. To the west is a vaulted opening,
large enough for a giant or two to pass through. Peering toward that
direction, you see what appear to be stone shelves and a quiet place to
read. The striated rock on the eastern wall is covered with naturally
glowing lichen. The floor below and the high ceiling are both dark.</pre>
