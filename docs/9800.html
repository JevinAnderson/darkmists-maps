  <h1>The Marauder's Shrine</h1>
  <pre>Every part of this room is made out of a pure, unstained onyx.
Even the lightest noise made can be heard echoing slightly,
bouncing off the reflecting surface of the walls. No torches or
lights shine in this room. A black glow lights up this room,
and it emanates from the onyx statue in the middle of the room.</pre>
