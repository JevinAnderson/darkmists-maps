  <h1>Edge of the Oasis</h1>
  <pre>Your senses do not deceive you, it is in fact an oasis that you saw
so long ago. Date and fig trees surrounded by copious amounts of
hardy grass and scrub brushes fill the oasis. You stand at the outer
most fringes of the Oasis where the sand continually tries to bury
the foliage but to no avail. To the east the side of a medium sized
tent blocks your view. Even from this distance you can hear the
sound of animals and..people?</pre>
