  <h1>The Witch Wood</h1>
  <pre>You are in the eerie domain of the Weird Sisters.  Ghost lights flicker
palely about your feet and cast a shadowed eye on a variety of rotting
plants and animals that cover the forest floor.  The twisted thorn trees
groan at your approach, and you are aware of a slow hissing that seems
to taunt you from the cover of darkness.  The forest stretches on for
miles.</pre>
