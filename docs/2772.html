  <h1>Pasture</h1>
  <pre>Through the enlightened methods of irrigation, the Lord of the
Manor was able to turn this edge of the desert into a lush pasture
for the use of his cattle and sheep. North is the path through the
Manor, south is the barn, and the pasture extends to the east and
southeast.</pre>
