  <h1>Alcove</h1>
  <pre>This part of the underground tunnels is obviously a storage room. Standing
against the striated walls, shelves hold a number of items which are put on
sale to the east. Other things are piled up on the hard rock floor. Softly
glowing lichen lend a bit of light without giving off nasty smoke as a fire
would do. The ceiling is too high to see clearly.</pre>
