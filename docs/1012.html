    <pre class="room-description">This place is barren, the rock untouched by the chisel or the dark
magic that has touched the rest of the complex. It is dark, slimy
creatures thriving on the filth. A sharp, coppery smell prevails
within the chamber, filling your throat, burning your eyes. It is
a familiar stench, associated with the casualties of war, flanked
always by Death itself. You stand upon a ledge, small, a rough
path resembling stairs leading downward. The entire western half
of the room is but a sea of churning blood. It rushes over stained
rocks, soaked for all time in the ichor of tainted innocence. Upon
one of the dryer rocks, a skull has been laid, cracked, yet almost
untouched by the scarlet flow. A smaller, thinner skeleton is curled
through the sockets of the eyes. It is a snake, a foolish serpent
that somehow stranded itself, a mistake that evidently was its end.
The roar of the falling blood echoes from the walls, filling your
ears, making almost all other sound inaudible. You can follow the
twisting path downward, to the base of the Bloodfall, or east, out
of this cavernous room.</pre>
