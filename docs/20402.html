  <h1>Woodland practice yard</h1>
  <pre>Thick, impassable shrubs and trees surround this 'practice yard' on the north,
east, and south. The ground is hard rock covered with soil, but nothing
attempts to grow upon it, for the students who practice here keep it well
tamped down. A thick canopy of leaves keeps this area dark, even during day-
light hours. Toward the west the 'practice yard' continues.</pre>
