  <h1>Wading in the Spring near the Waterfall</h1>
  <pre>You found your way into the spring water which forms a small shallow lake
at the base of the rocky cliffs. The water is a clear blue color, reflecting
the sky above, yet allowing one to see the lakebed below. You can tell that
there are little plants growing there, and small fish occasionally show
themselves as they dart from one plant to another. Rocks abound in the
northern section, where a waterfall crashes down, sending watery spray
everywhere. Looking at the lakebed again, you don't see where the water
might be draining, and yet the water level is always the same. The shallow
lake extends to the south.</pre>
