  <h1>Kitchen</h1>
  <pre>Tables for chopping vegetables line one wall, tables for cutting
meat line another. In the center is an open fire, above which
is a metallic cone supported by three cast iron posts. A pipe
leads from the cone to the ceiling, and out through the roof. Two
sturdy posts support a bar from which hangs a cauldron.</pre>
