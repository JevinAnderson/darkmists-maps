  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path converges from three directions,
extending to the north, south, and east as it encircles
a miniature forest garden. To the northeast, the ground
is covered with moss and grasses, and the small trees
growing there are deciduous, their branches following the
will of the seasons, with leaves budding, growing, turning
darker green, then to brilliant golds and scarlets, and
then, brittle brown, falling to the ground and leaving
bare branches to rustle in the winter winds. In miniature,
these trees are exquisite, regardless of the season. To
the west, a couple of fern trees grow, surrounded by small
bushes with tiny, brilliant red roses blooming within
thorny cages.</pre>
