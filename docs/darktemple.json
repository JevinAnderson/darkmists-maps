All around you the earth has been\nscorched and charred, as if hell itself opened up and formed a perfect rift\nto populate with its denizens. Beyond the droning hum of insects, you can\nmake out an occasional scream. Smoke and ash plumes drift from the ground,\ncausing eye irritation. All around the pit small totems bearing the likeness\nof foul beings have been erected.  They seem to be glaring in your direction.\nThe longer you remain, the more uncomfortable you become as the smell of blood\nmixed with burning flesh assaults your olfactory senses with unabated force.\nA vile place indeed lurks before you, and your senses advise you to turn back.",

From cracks in the earth squirm and crawl\na horde of the most unpleasant insects Thera has seen: scarab dung beetles,\ncentipedes, cockroaches, scorpions, and pincer insects.  They meander the\nscorched earth in search of prey to overwhelm and devour. There appear to be\nno other signs of life nearby but you can sense that arched tunnels have been\ncarved roughly into the earth here to provide passage. To access the tunnels,\nhowever, you must first pass through burning archways.  The source of the\nflames is unknown, but it seems as though to proceed further in this foul\nplace, you must be willing to endure hardship and suffering.  Looking up,\na rabid swarm of insects swarms over the pit, deterring would-be intruders.",
