  <h1>Smokey's Supplies</h1>
  <pre>You enter a lodge which sits under the shade of an ancient Redwood tree.
All manner of supplies and equipment useful to rangers and woodkeepers
are neatly stacked on shelves or stored in closets.  A parchment tacked
on a wall lists the supplies which you may purchase from Smokey, the
Ranger Bear who runs the supply store.</pre>
