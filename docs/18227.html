  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path stretches northward and southward.
Along the east and west sides of the path, thin trunked
trees rise up, their bark smooth and grey except where
nature has peeled it away from the trunk. These trees
were graced with a thin canopy which allows the sun to
filter through the intermittant shade it provides. Ivy,
whose leaves measure about five inches across, covers
the ground. Along the east side of the path, a stream
of water gurgles northward. Along the west side of the
path, flowers grow within a neatly kept flowerbed, into
which the ivy attempts to crawl.</pre>
