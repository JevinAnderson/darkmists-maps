You stand in the massive center of a scorched pit in the earth. Wisps of hazy
smoke rise up from the hot surface of the pit, and the smell of sulfur and
burnt flesh is very strong here.  From cracks in the earth squirm and crawl
a horde of the most unpleasant insects Thera has seen: scarab dung beetles,
centipedes, cockroaches, scorpions, and pincer insects.  They meander the
scorched earth in search of prey to overwhelm and devour. There appear to be
no other signs of life nearby but you can sense that arched tunnels have been
carved roughly into the earth here to provide passage. To access the tunnels,
however, you must first pass through burning archways.  The source of the
flames is unknown, but it seems as though to proceed further in this foul
place, you must be willing to endure hardship and suffering.  Looking up,
a rabid swarm of insects swarms over the pit, deterring would-be intruders.</pre
