  <h1>Covenant Library</h1>
  <pre>The Covenant realizes that history at times does repeat itself
and lessons of the past can be lessons for the future.  In light
of this, the Covenant made a library to store a lot of old military
history books in addition to their own books.  A very beautiful
young human member of the Chaplain Corps serves as a librarian
here, swiftly finding requested books.  A sign is mounted on
the wall.</pre>
