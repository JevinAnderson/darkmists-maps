  <h1>Path in the Desert</h1>
  <pre>A path lined with rocks leads through the outskirts of the Sands
of Sorrow. Sand has blown in from the south to finely cover the
road. You see a myriad of footprints here but cannot make out
whose they are. You hear an occasional splash. To the north is a
wooden bridge.</pre>
