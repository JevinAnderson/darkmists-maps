  <h1>Crippling Vertigo</h1>
  <pre>You feel bewildered and disoritented.  Your brain, barely able to focus, is
howling at you to stay alert.  Your senses all seem to be lying to you at
this point, and you feel helplessly vulnerable to attack. The walls and floor
of this strange place are in constant flux, spinning and oscillating wildly
and making your head spin. You wonder if you can even gain footing in here to
make your way forward. The walls crackle intensely with psionic energy and seem
to register your unwelcome presence with hostility. You feel your mind exerting
a constant effort just to keep a strange presence from turning your brain to
scrambled eggs. You feel exhausted from the effort, yet the flow of mana
coursing its way through your body also seems to be increased.  The smell of
rotting things and old mildew is heavy in the air here, and every once in a
while,  a strange breeze flows through this "tunnel". Or did you imagine that
breeze? In fact, you're not quite sure if you can trust yoursenses in this
place with any reliability at all. Cardinal directions have become hazy.</pre>
