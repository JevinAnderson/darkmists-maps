  <h1>Conference Room</h1>
  <pre>Meeting delegates within cramped and sometimes smelly barracks
isn't very polite, and having meetings crouched in the hallways
or in the mess hall feels unprofessional, and so the Covenant
built this very lavish room with extremely soft, self cleaning
and repairing carpets, a beautiful table, fancy well cushioned
chairs, and a marvelous chandelier as well as a cart loaded with
food and drink.  The room is used often as a delegate meeting
room, or as a meeting room for Covenant officers.  A sign is
mounted to a painted marble wall.</pre>
