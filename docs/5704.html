  <h1>The Inner Keep</h2>
  <pre>This is the heart of the Castle Balkra. The massive stone ceiling of the
inner keep arches overhead. Oversized Roman arches are formed from large
granite stones, allowing entrance or exit in all the cardinal directions.
Suits of various armors decorate this well traveled hall at various spots.
The grey stone floor is polished to a near mirror shine. Along the floor
toward the west, running north and south along the walls in the passages to
the north and south, is a marble pipe. The walls are covered with dried
blood in the shape of human hand prints haphazardly spaced, some overlapping.
