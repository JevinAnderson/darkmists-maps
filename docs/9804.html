  <h1>Dining Hall</h1>
  <pre>Beyond the archway to this room, the ceiling expands upward
for several feet. The walls widen out to accommodate the tables
set up in rows across half of the floor. The other half of the
room appears to be a very busy kitchen. A fire is burning in an
oversized fireplace, perfectly sized for the massive pot that is
in it. Tables with various kitchen utensils surround the
remainder of the kitchen.</pre>
