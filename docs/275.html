  <h1>The Wood-Path</h1>
  <pre>The Wood-path you're following gets more pronounced and used here,
a testimony that the Emerald Forest isn't populated (or at least
explored and travelled) only by its original furry or buzzing citizens.
Multi-coloured flowers dance gaily in the wind while clinging to the feet
of the tall oak and pine trees flanking the forest road. Flying
squirrels leap from branch to branch, probably searching for a
delicious cashew or two.</pre>
