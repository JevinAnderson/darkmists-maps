  <h1>The Ruined Monastery</h1>
  <pre>Tangled vines of ivy hang down from what remains of the arch-entranced
of this small monastery.  It is ruined beyond repair and seems to have
been abandoned many years ago.  There is a quiet and melancholic silence
in the air.  You notice footprints in the dust that lead west into a
leaf-strewn courtyard and continue into a small chapel.  You notice for
the first time that that area of the monastery seems to have been spared
the dereliction that the rest of the monastery has fallen into.</pre>
