The long rug continues down the mansion, its crimson threads almost
appearing as a river of blood gushing through the hallway.  Light is
dimly provided by a few scattered candles sitting on small tables
lining the hallway, clearly at one point valuable but now fallen into
the same decrepit state as the entire mansion.  Spiders spin their
webs proudly in every nook and cranny of the hall in celebration of
their victory over the original inhabitants of the building.  On the
northern wall a large poster is nailed, bearing some information the
Syndicate has seen fit to disseminate to the public.  To the south a
discrete door gives entry to a somehow darker room than the rest of
this actively decaying mansion, while the hallway meanders toward
the east.</pre
