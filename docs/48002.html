  <h1>A Guest Room</h1>
  <pre>Evidently at one point the occupants of this mansion had occasion to
host guests, and this is where they were kept.  A large bed dominates
the room, providing an opportunity to rest for those taking advantage
of the Syndicate safe house.  A small nightstand rests in the corner
next to the bed, where a solitary candle slowly melts, creating an
atmosphere somehow more dour and dark than the rest of the building.
A faded painting hangs on the wall, depicting Arkham at its height.
This room could desperately use the attention of a maid, but given
your surroundings, that appears very unlikely.  A door to the north
provides access to the rest of the house.</pre>
