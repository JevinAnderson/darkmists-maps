  <h1>At the Well</h1>
  <pre>The well was constructed here to take advantage of the river
without falling prey to the steep banks to the north. You can
see the river from here, it flows silently and slow. To the
east is a small building. A new road is being built to the
north, leading to the river.</pre>
