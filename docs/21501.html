  <h1>Forest Clearing</h1>
  <pre>A large clearing here in the forest has a singular focus: an enormous tower.
Jutting out from the very center of the clearing, puncturing the canopy and
stabbing the sky, the Hourglass Tower, home to the Conclave of Wizardry.  The
tower is truly a magnificent structure, perfectly cylindrical in form with a
slight pinch in the middle, it is composed of a white marble with veins of
black and grey.  Windows circle up the entire length, some are lit.  A small
bridge crosses a pool surrounding the tower and ends in a large gateway
leading deeper into the edifice.  From 3 visible square holes in the tower,
approximately 30 feet off the ground, water flows down into the small circular
pool currently coursing around the tower.  Some form of magic allows the water
to part around the bridge on either side to keep the bridge occupants dry.
There is a wide area separating the forest from the start of the bridge, it is
covered in simple grass, which seems to be largely trodden upon by countless
visitors.</pre>
