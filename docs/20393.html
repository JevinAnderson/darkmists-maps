  <h1>On a path</h1>
  <pre>The path here curves to the east and south. It is formed of hard rock and
strewn with soil. Toward the west are tall trees left to grow unhindered.
From the south you hear sounds of fighting and grunting. Near the edge of
the path, a wooden sign stands about eye-level to a halfling.</pre>
