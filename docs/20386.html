  <h1>On a path</h1>
  <pre>The rock-hard path splits toward the north, south, and east here. To the west
is a woodland which the city planners chose to leave be, to grow unhindered.
Left to themselves, the trees have grown high and thick, lending a canopy of
leaves to give the natural city a pleasant shade. Thick shrubs attempt to
prevent easy passage through this wild woodland. Looking south, you see a
striped fence.</pre>
