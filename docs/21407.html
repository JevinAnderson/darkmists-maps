    <pre class="room-description">Reddish specks of light from an unknown source flicker in the cavern,
darting from one portion of the cavern to the other. The floor here
is a large iron grate and littered with maggots and rotting matter.
Numerous implements of torture are scattered about in disarray.  Within
the dim light you notice several creatures staring back at you languidly...
some not at all.  There are hairy chunks of flesh dangling from the
ceiling on hooks supported by chains.  The walls radiate with evil and
pulsate red with your every heartbeat. The walls, made of solid black
glass, have protruding spikes to keep you from even thinking of going
anywhere.  The chamber is filled with the sound of rain as the blood
falls through the grate into the room below.</pre>
