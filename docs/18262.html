  <h1>The Massive Cavern of the Lady of Purity</h1>
  <pre>The walls broaden and part here to reveal a room full of light.
A silver staircase leads upward to the top of what appears to be
a tower built through the top of the cavern. The floor of the
cavern is lined with beautiful rugs of swirly designs, with greens
and blues predominating, as though they were mimicking water. Upon
the walls hang tapestries alive with many different hues,
portraying woodlands, prairies, meadows, hillocks, mountains,
deserts, water, and tunnels beneath the ground.</pre>
