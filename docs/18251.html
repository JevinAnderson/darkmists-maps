  <h1>Along a path of polished stone</h1>
  <pre>The stone beneath you is polished to what appears to be a perfect shine.
Overhead is a ceiling of rock, extending from the wall to the west. To
the east is a spring of clear blue water. The path is wider here than to
the north, and from the look of it, might be wider to the south than here.
You hear the sound of water falling, both above you and to the north. If
you are careful, you can enter the spring to the east.</pre>
