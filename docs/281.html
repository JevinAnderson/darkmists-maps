  <h1>The Bonanza</h1>
  <pre>Standing here at the south-west end of the Brownie-Pixie Bonanza
Festival, your senses are quickly overloaded with sight, sound
and smell. Brownies clad in soft brown cloth with little feathered
hats mingle happily with their slightly smaller and greener cousins,
the forest pixies. An almost musical chitter-chatter fills the
air, while the aroma of freshly baked treats drift in from the
north. There seems to be a forest dweller's competition, what
with the many games the pixies and brownies seem to be playing. A tug
of war is currently in progress, with the heaving Brownies having
a slight lead over the grunting Pixies.</pre>
