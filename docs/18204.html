  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The stone path meanders to the north and west here, dipping with
the land. To either side of it are tall trees, their trunks covered
with coarse bark. It is delightfully shady here, as a canopy of
thick leaves holds back the harshest heat from the sun during the
day. Alongside the trees, thick shrubs grow, their green leaves
dotted with little berries. A thin stream of running water follows
the path toward the east and the north. Its origin appears to be
beyond a thick growth of trees to the west.</pre>
