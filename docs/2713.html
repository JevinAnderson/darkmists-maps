  <h1>By the White-Washed Gate</h1>
  <pre>Two white-washed poles rise from the ground on either side of the
path, and between them is a wooden gate, also white-washed. Across
the top is a sign suspended from the two poles by a couple of chains,
swinging gently in the breeze. Beyond the gate the path continues,
and you can see past the thick row of shrubs to see a field of crops
to the north of the path, and a pasture and a barn to the south. The
path leads westward away from the gate.</pre>
