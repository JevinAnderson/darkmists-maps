  <h1>A Creaky Stairway</h1>
  <pre>You can almost hear dice rattling in your head with every step you
take on this staircase.  One misstep would likely have you tumbling
down the stairs to certain injury.  An untrustworthy bannister does
offer its support, though various beams and railings are missing.
The same maroon carpet in the rest of the mansion runs up these
stairs, though there are some slightly darker blotches staining
various places on it.  Shadows creep down the staircase from
upstairs, looking thoroughly dangerous.</pre>
