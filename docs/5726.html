  <h1>The Armory</h2>
  <pre>The thick stone stairs lead straight down into this room. The air here seems
a bit more moist and the temperature a bit cooler. Moss seems to thrive on
the smooth stone walls that make up the basement room here. The room slopes
to form a pit for weapons and gear won in battles but not needed. Visible
exits are to the south and the stairs leading upward. The scent of alcohol
wafts in from the south.</pre>
