    <h1 class="room-header">Along the garden path</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">The natural rock path extends eastward and westward as it
encircles a miniature forest garden. To the south, cracked
boulders serve as a perch for a number of small weather-
hardy pine trees whose trunks have been blown in different
directions over time, resulting in cascading branches and
twisted trunks. Ever green, they cling to life on those
boulders. To the north, the ground is covered with moss and
grasses, and the small trees growing there are subject to
the will of the seasons, with leaves budding, growing,
turning darker green and then brilliant gold and scarlet,
and finally, brittle brown, falling from bare branches
rustling in the chill winter winds. These miniature trees
are exquisite at any time of the year. To the south, a
few fern trees grow, surrounded by small bushes with tiny,
brilliant red roses blooming within thorny cages.</pre>
