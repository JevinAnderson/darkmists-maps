  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The rock path follows a somewhat east-west direction, lending itself
naturally to the uneven ground. To either side of the natural path
are tall, thick-trunked trees, their bark coarse and rough to the
touch. High above, a canopy of leaves lends shade to the path during
the sunniest days. A low-hanging branch promises trouble to those
who travel here without ducking low beneath it. Shrubs reach out
with thorny branches among deep green leaves. A thin stream of
running water follows the path, heading eastward. Its origin seems
to be beyond the thick growth of trees to the west.</pre>
