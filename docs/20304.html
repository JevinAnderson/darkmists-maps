  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The smooth brown and grey striation of the rock to the east and west of you
is illuminated by a natural glowing lichen which grows in various parts of
the tunnel. A number of clumps of it are on the walls, while others are on
the ceiling. None of it grows on the ground. To the east you can sense a
light of a different kind. Westward the tunnel opens up.</pre>
