  <h1>Hall</h1>
  <pre>The grains of the wood-panelled walls of this hallway make
patterns that seem to dance in the flickering torchlight. There
are niches in the sides of the hall for people to stand out of
the way if they wish to converse in the hall. There is a hole
in the floor with a ladder running down into the room below; a
large doorway sits in front of a room to the east, and the hall
continues to the north.</pre>
