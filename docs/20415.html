  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>A dark canopy of green leaves arcs over the hard path beneath you. To either
side of you, eastward and westward, woods grow thick and unhindered, with
berry-rich bushes lending a lovely greenness at eye-level. The soil-strewn
path stretches northward and southward. Little plants line the hard path,
their light green leaves and brilliant red blossoms lending a little color to
the darkness. The buzzing of honey bees is evident, but only occasionally do
you see one sipping nectar from the blossoms below.</pre>
