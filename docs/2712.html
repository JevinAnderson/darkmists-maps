  <h1>Path in the Desert</h1>
  <pre>You walk upon a well-trodden path, darker soil mixed with sand from
the desert to the south and lined by a neat row of stones. The path
turns here, stretching to the north and to the east. Looking east,
you see a gate. Southeast you see a line of thick shrubs.</pre>
