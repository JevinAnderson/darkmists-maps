  <h1>The Crusader Forge</h2>
  <pre>The tremendous heat almost forces you back out of the room. A blinding light
of molten metals being poured into casts forces your eyes to squint. A large
draconian blacksmith and a gnome weaponsmith work this hellish heated forge
in a furious pace. Nearby, a dwarven mastersmith works the bellows and over-
looks the work. The clanging of metalwork rings throughout the keep, and you
see quenching barrels, filled with different liquids lining the side of the
smithy. A heavy metallic scent looms from the various metals being crafted in
the forge. A heat wave shimmers over the room, distorting your sight. The
blast of heat makes you sweat, and you almost feel as if on fire. Many fine
swords, shields, armors, and weapons of every sort crafted here line the
walls. A cast-iron plaque hangs on the wall near the anvil.</pre>
