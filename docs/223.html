  <h1>The Wall of Shadows</h1>
  <pre>You step into shadows and suddenly hellish voices shriek into your ears.
Your light flares brightly for an instant and you see the trees around
you writhing while they burn in black flames.  They bend their branches
into a series of glyphs and runes, forming an archway across the entrance
of a cavern to the east.  The voices stop suddenly, and you are once again
all alone in the darkness.</pre>
