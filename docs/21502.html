    <pre class="room-description">The interior of the tower is a magnificent spectacle to behold.  This main
entryway serves as the hub of all movement into and out of the Hourglass
tower.  People of all races, cultures and backgrounds are here, moving about
freely.  Some wish you well as they pass with a slight nod, others give you
darting looks.  A large staircase is set into the northern wall of the area,
leading up to the higher levels of the tower.  Looking up, you can see walk-
ways set into the side of the tower, circling its edge.  Upon these, you see
even more people moving along.  Looking straight up, you can almost see the
top of the tower, it appears to be many miles away.  To the east is a
corridor leading off, and the west will take one of the tower, and out toward
the forest.</pre>
