  <h1>Within the herb garden</h1>
  <pre>The smooth stone path here is well kept, free of pebbles or bits of soil.
Along the north and south edges of the path, you can tell that a gardener has
kept the small plant growth from extending beyond the garden. Within the
garden itself, herbs thrive, their spicy blooms attracting honeybees. The
path extends eastward and westward from here.</pre>
