  <h1>Humming Ethereal Passage</h1>
  <pre>You are in a violently humming tunnel. The walls of this place are made of a
strange ethereal fabric that is spongy and sticky to the touch, while a stream
of vile looking ooze courses along the floor. The walls hum with an intsense
psionic energy, and seem to register your unwelcome presence with hostility.
You feel your mind exerting a constant effort justto keep a strange presence
from  turning your brain to scrambled eggs. The effort to focus is exhausting,
yet the flow of mana coursing its way through your body also seems to be
increased. You may follow the passage west or descend here.</pre>
