  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The path formed of natural rock veers northward and westward
here, surrounding a deep pool of water to the northwest. From
here you can look across, west-north-westward, to a rock bridge,
and a waterfall formed from a gurgling stream, the waters of
which descend into the pool below. Tall trees growing south and
east of the path lend a canopy of leaves to form a shade, but
they do not extend over the pool, and during the day, the sun
sends its warm rays upon the water's surface, and sometimes
slips through and warms the rocks of the natural path. On a
lower level, thick shrubs grow between the tree trunks, their
foliage thick and green. The altitude changes as you travel,
rising toward the west, lowering toward the north.</pre>
