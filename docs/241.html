  <h1>By a Stream</h1>
  <pre>You stand by a wide stream that flows swiftly to the north.  Drawn by
the sudden sound of musical laughter, you look over the tops of some
lilac bushes and spy a group of nymphs frolicking in the stream.  It
seems like a vision captured from some nature god's idyllic dream.  You
hear the distant roar of a waterfall to your south.</pre>
