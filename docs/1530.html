  <h1>Execution Chamber</h1>
  <pre>This room is not mentioned much by the Covenant soldiers.  It's
a room of final judgement, where Covenant soldiers who absolutely
have failed their duties face a firing squad of elite female
drow soldiers armed with crossbows with negative material tipped
bolts.  For the Covenant soldier that has repeatedly failed their
duty, this is the last place they see before going to the great
beyond.  A number of caskets are stacked in a corner and one
wall has chains attached to it, with a blindfold lying on the
floor.</pre>
