  <h1>Fourth Floor</h1>
  <pre>The circular floor is a mosaic of polished stones held firmly in place. The
picture it forms is that of a lemniscate, or a figure 8 if you look at it
from the side view. Within one circular part of the 8 is a fiery phoenix
rising from dark ashes. Within the other circular part of the 8 is a swirly
darkness, as though the floor artist chose not to depict any specific holy
symbol, yet indicate that some darkness lay here. The walls have been
recently polished, its smooth stone surface very pretty. A stair of cast
iron leads upward, and near it, a polished silver stair leads downward.</pre>
