  <h1>Artifact Room</h1>
  <pre>The walls here are finished, a bluish marble with dainty veins of dark and
light. The floor, completely restored, is of a similar marble, only a darker
shade of blue, or maybe the veins are more dark than light. In each corner
is a tall, golden floor sconce bearing a thick grey candle, a total of four.
An open archway, lined with grey stone, leads to the north. A small sign on
the eastern wall proclaims that Xyza, Goddess of Magic, once referred to
this room as the Artifact Room.</pre>
