  <h1>Eastern Womb</h1>
  <pre>The rock column opens up to reveal another dimly-lit yet spacious cavern
within the desolate cave. Several butchered carcasses are partly dug into
the ground, a form of ritual burial gone awry. A scant few of the remains
are intact; some bones are smashed into tiny pieces by a blunt force, the
majority with obvious chew-marks. Distinct impressions on the guano-filled
cave floor indicate plenty of scuffles have occurred here. The mucky ground
here slopes downward in a similar fashion to other caverns of this level.
There is a rustling in the nearby alcove.</pre>
