    <pre class="room-description">The stronghold opens into a massive central chamber, lit by natural
light streaming through a glass dome perhaps forty feet above. Your view
of the dome is slightly obstructed by a walkway the seems to connect
rooms at either end of the second floor of the stronghold. Benches of
stone line the curved walls of the chamber, offering places of rest to
tired lawmen. In the middle of the room is a magnificent fountain,
layered in rising concentric circles of marble and surrounded by lush,
flowering greenery. Atop a high pedestal at the fountain's crown stands a
large Scale of bright bronze, untarnished by the vapor that the splashing
water produces. A small room opens up to the west.</pre>
