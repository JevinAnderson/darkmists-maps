  <h1>The Tombstone</h1>
  <pre>There is something rather peculiar about this part of the Emerald
Forest. A small tombstone sits in the middle of a small clearing.
Carved from a white substance, its shiny surface reflects what
little sunlight that manages to escape from the umbrella covering
of trees surrounding the grave. Freshly picked flowers lie at the
foot of the tombstone, while strange symbols are lovingly engraved
on it. The strange thing is there are no paths leading from or to the
area, which would puzzle even the most observant elf or ranger. Who
would pick flowers for a lone grave and leave no evidence of passing?</pre>
