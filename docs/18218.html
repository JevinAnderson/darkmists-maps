  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>A natural rock path encircles a deep pool of water to the west
and northwest. From where you stand, you can look west across
the way and see a rock bridge stradling a stream whose water
falls upon a rough rock face into the pool below. The path
below you is uneven, sloping downward toward the north, upward
toward the south.</pre>
