  <h1>The compound barracks</h1>
  <pre>The barracks of the compound are made of the same stone and polished marble as
the rest of the building. Bunk beds line the stone walls, and there is a large
woven rug covering the cold marble floor. Overall, the room seems rather
spartan, lacking in the usual comforts associated with sleeping chambers.</pre>
