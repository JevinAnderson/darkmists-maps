  <h1>The Great Hall</h1>
  <pre>A great hall sits here. The walls are lined with pictures of past
distinguished members of the Ancient Order of the Justicar. Other relics
of the past are framed along the walls. Small inscriptions describe their
significance. At the eastern end of the hall lies the Council chambers
while the western side of the hall takes you into a place of great power.
You may also exit the hall southward along the suspended walkway.</pre>
