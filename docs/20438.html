  <h1>On a path</h1>
  <pre>The path here leads north and south. It is hard stone, liberally covered with
soil, from which the occasional blade of grass or leafy ground cover sort of
plant attempts to grow. To the west is a well-kept herb garden, its flowers
sending spicy scents into the air. Honey bees flit and buzz by those spicy
flowers, gathering nectar.</pre>
