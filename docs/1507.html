    <pre class="room-description">The room is unlit with any major light source and is a little
dark.  A half dozen candles scattered around the room provide
a little bit of light, and the statue of the Dark Maiden glows
with a soft white light as it seems to smile at you and watch
you.  The walls have been carved to depict every single soldier
sworn to the Covenant, a new face appearing by itself whenever
someone is promoted to the Knighthood.  The eyes of the carvings
are made of what appears to be precious gems and they glow without
any light source behind them.  Three cushioned kneeling benches
are arranged before the altar of this holy ground.  A doorway
leads south to a room filled with cots.</pre>
