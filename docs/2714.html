  <h1>By the White-Washed Gate</h1>
  <pre>To the west is a white-washed gate between two tall white poles. A
sign suspended between the poles above you swings gently in the
breeze. Nothing is written on the sign that you can see. To the
north is a crop field, to the south pasture. The path of dark soil
well trod upon extends eastward through this manor, and through and
past the gate to the west.</pre>
