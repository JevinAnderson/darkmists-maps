  <h1>Closet</h1>
  <pre>The walls of this small room are very smooth and unadorned. A
pile of rags can be seen in one corner, the smells of soap and
murky water wafting up from them. A large rug covers the portion
of the floor on the opposite side of the room from the rags. It
is not a very comfortable place.</pre>
