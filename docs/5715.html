    <h1>A large Crusader Barracks</h1>
    <pre>
You enter a large Crusader barracks. Oversized cots, bunks, and storage
trunks line the walls. All look large enough to be comfortable to the larger
races. Any Troll, Giant, or Minotaur would find the size of things
compatable. To the north side of the barracks stalls have been constructed
with hay for the centaur race's needs. A large fireplace to the east radiates
heat enough to warm the whole barracks.</pre
