  <h1>Kevinlape's Butchery</h1>
  <pre>The front room of the huge cabin, obviously built for a giant to live
within, is devoted to the preparation of meat and the selling of those
delightful dishes. This store is filled with the aroma of roasting meats,
thankfully overpowering the smell of raw meat hanging behind the wooden
counter. You see a huge fireplace along the eastern wall, where the
meats are being roasted. The countertop is stained with blood, but it is
otherwise kept clean for safe preparation of food.</pre>
