  <h1>The Village Square</h1>
  <pre>A couple of farmers are erecting a "Harvest Moon Festival" sign over
where you are standing.  A gaggle of goodwives are gossiping by the
village well while their children are chasing a playful dog.  An apple
tree lends its shade to two old men who are sharing a large tankard of
cider.  You see a large farm to the north and espy a dirt track which
leads west from the village and then turns north to a ruined abbey.</pre>
