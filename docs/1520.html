  <h1>Covert Operations Recreation Room</h1>
  <pre>The Covert Operations branch of the Covenant, commonly known
as Ghosts, like training themselves constantly, practicing their
skills of subterfuge and striking from the shadows.  The room
is littered with a variety of locks of different makes, bells
hung on ropes and other odd things that only Ghosts know about.</pre>
