  <h1>The Matrix</h1>
  <pre>Black walls lined with a translucent silver enclose this entire space.
Reflective light from an unknown source shines all about in a mirror-like
fashion. Geometric shapes float all around, and some even phase through you
as a ghost would. Looking closer at them, folds unfold and seams burst, forming
a differing view of each shape at any given time. A set of gleaming green
objects float downward at a fast pace, forming what look to be akin to lines.
A light of almost star quality bounces around the entire matrix, slowly and
then quickly in a chaotic fashion.</pre>
