  <h1>The Chamber of Decisions</h1>
  <pre>A long charred table passes through the center of the room. Its legs
are uneven, causing it to rock at the slightest touch. With a seating
capacity of 12, it requires the lower ranked Crusaders to stand. On
the blackened wall is a charred mural which covers most of the eastern
wall.  In the eastern corner of the north wall is a passage leading
further to the north.  Opposite it on the southern wall is a passage
leading to the south.  The Chamber of Decisions is where Crusaders come
to discuss problems and solve arguments.  In the middle of the table is
a large hole, charred and jagged, as though gouged by lightning.</pre>
