  <h1>Within a garden</h1>
  <pre>You've managed to stumble into an oriental home. A small wooden hut
sits to the south of a garden lovingly nurtured with blooming yellow,
white and red flower blossoms. Two stone lions sit on wooden pillars
guarding entrance to the garden, while two jade dragons guard the door
to the hut proper. A small bucket pulled well stands next to a pen of
chickens and ducks who cluck and quack away merrily. Carrots, cabbages
and rice are grown in a medium sized plot of land to the north. There
is a small rock pool to the east.</pre>
