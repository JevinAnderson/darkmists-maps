  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>A dark canopy of green leaves arcs over the hard path beneath you. To either
side of you, eastward and westward, are woods growing thick and unhindered.
The soil-strewn path stretches northward and southward. Little plants line
the hard path, their light green and bright orange blooms lending a little
color to the darkness. The buzzing of honey bees is evident, but only occas-
ionally do you see one sipping nectar from the orange flowers below. Beyond
the low growing plants are shrubs with lush, dark green leaves and sweet
berries.</pre>
