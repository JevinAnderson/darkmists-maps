  <h1>A Fog-Shrouded Trail</h1>
  <pre>You are on a fog-shrouded trail which runs up the side of this dark
mountain.  The ground is wet and muddy with melted snow, and the path
which should lead to the Miden'nir disappears amongst the mist and the
trees.  There is nothing for you to do but follow the trail that twists
up towards the broken, snow-covered heights of the mountain range.
An old stone tablet with inscriptions stands beside a bush in the
corner.</pre>
