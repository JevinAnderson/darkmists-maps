  <h1>On a path</h1>
  <pre>Rock-hard, strewn with soil, the path beneath you leads in several directions.
To the north, it seems to slope downward. More level travelling is to be had
to the east, south, and west. Toward the northwest you see herbs and spice
plants. Southwest and southeast are tall trees.</pre>
