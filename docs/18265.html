  <h1>The Massive Cavern of the Lady of Purity</h1>
  <pre>Lining the walls of the cavern here are a number of staffs,
knives, and pelts. A shelf carved in the stone wall holds
a number of jars containing herbs. A collection of seeds
sits within a box set on one shelf. Polished horns and
antlers adorn part of the wall, as well as a few trophy
heads from various animals. A large club leans against
the corner of two of the walls. This part of the cavern
appears to be a monument to the ranger guild.</pre>
