From a side glance, the\nstone formation appears to be a domelike structure; the top portion\nslants downwards, sinking heavily into the earth, instead of continuing\nstraight further down the back.  A thick cloud of rubble, dirt, sand,\nand plant debris partly conceals the narrow aperture of this rockpile,\nan entrance to the subterranean depths within. The cold, damp air\noriginating from inside the structure is seemingly inviting and a\ncomforting means of escape from the excessively dry and humid\nsurroundings of the expanse northwards.  A stone 'monolith' formed\nfrom lava rock with 'writing' upon it stands near the passageway.",
