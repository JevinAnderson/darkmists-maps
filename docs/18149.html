  <h1>The Crusader Recruiting Center</h1>
  <pre>You stand in a small recruiting office for the Clan of Steel.
Tapestries and paintings on the walls show scenes of warriors
bearing the mark of the Gauntlet doing battle with all types of
mages. Simple wooden benches along the wall provide a place for
those who have come seeking knowledge a place to rest, and an
old battlescarred veteran stands near the back of the office waiting
to answer questions. A simple wooden sign hangs on the wall here.
An open door leads out into the city streets.</pre>
