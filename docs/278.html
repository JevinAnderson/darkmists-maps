    <pre class="room-description">You've managed to wander into a small silent grove in the forest.
For some strange reason most of the forest noises seem to have
disappeared, though you can feel the rustle of the leaves beneath
your feet as you walk. The silence isn't really eerie, however, but
more of a contemplative quietness. Small stones are arranged in an odd
fashion on the ground, much the way seating chairs would be arranged
should the speaker be in the middle of a circle. It's almost as though
a little tribe of beavers just had a river-dam guild meeting and have
left for lunch.</pre>
