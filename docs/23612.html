  <h1>High Arbiter's Office</h1>
  <pre>This office is sparsely decorated. A massive desk sits facing the door
while an uncomfortable wooden chair sits behind it. A small potted plant
sits by a large window on the western wall through which you can see lush
forest as far as the eye can see. Bookshelves line both the northern and
southern walls of the room and are filled with numerous tomes about the
law and various other subjects. A deep-blue colored rug covers part of
the marble floor with the Seal of Justice at its center. You may exit
back to the stairwell to the east.</pre>
