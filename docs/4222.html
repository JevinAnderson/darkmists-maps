  <h1>The Totem Cave</h1>
  <pre>This subterranean cave is different from the rest of the Temple of Darkness.
A cold wind blows, despite the molten heat from geothermal energies. Various
relics and totems have been erected all around the room, taking the visages
of creatures both animal and demonic. The totems have all been inscribed with
unholy runes, and their eyes fixate upon you as you move about the chamber.
Horrifying insects of all shapes and sizes undulate and crawl about the cave
in search of fresh meat, sending shivers down your spine.  Meanwhile, the
Totems have taken note of you and if you stare at them long enough, their
expressions and positions seem to change and warp. What this means, only
the Depraved truly know.</pre>
