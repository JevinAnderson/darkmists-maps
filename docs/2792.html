  <h1>Field</h1>
  <pre>Through the enlightened methods of irrigation, the Lord of the
Manor was able to turn this edge of the desert into usable
cropland. Rows and rows of grain and vegetable crops grow well
here, irrigated from the river to the north. To the north is a
wall of shrubs and trees planted as a windblock for protection
of the fields from the harsh winds of the desert. From beyond
that living wall you hear the sound of an occasional splash.</pre>
