    <pre class="room-description">A path lined with rocks leads through the outskirts of the Sands of
Sorrow. Sand has blown in from the south to finely cover the road.
You see a myriad of footprints here but cannot make out whose they
are. Looking across some of the barren land you see a line of shrubs
or maybe trees, but the land between this path and that not quite
natural wall is very sandy and difficult to traverse. Sticking with
the path makes more sense here.</pre>
