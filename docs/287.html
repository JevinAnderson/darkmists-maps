  <h1>Yun Fei Yang's humble abode</h1>
  <pre>You stand in the living room of a small wooden hut. A small partitioned
kitchen is to the south of here. The spartan furniture, tidiness and
simple basic furniture hint at the occupier's character. There is a
beautiful painting of a young oriental woman dressed in long flowing
silk on one of the walls. Parchments with foreign exotic wordings in
flowing black ink script sit on a desk. A small book catches your eye,
its title being "Zhuge Liang's Chinese-Theran Dictionary". Some of
the scrolls here are written in a language you can understand.</pre>
