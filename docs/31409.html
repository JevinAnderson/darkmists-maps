  <h1>A Turn in the Well-Kept Path</h1>
  <pre>A path of flat white stones leads east and south. To either side
of the path are colorful wildflowers in low-trimmed lawn. To the
west is a pristine marble building. In bas-relief next to the
door is a paladinic figure, knightly, in a stance which portrays
both courage and mercy. The door to the building is closed, but
it does not appear locked. Above the door is a golden nameplate,
engraved upon which is the name, 'CEDRIC LIGHTSHIELD'.</pre>
