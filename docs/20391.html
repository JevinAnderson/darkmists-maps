    <pre class="room-description">The ground is smooth and rock-hard, formed of dark, striated stone. To the
west, a number of thickly growing trees blocks your view, as to the east. A
fence formed of striated zebrawood prevents your movement toward the south,
where the ground falls quite suddenly to a ravine where a river flows. To the
west-south-west you see a breathtaking waterfall, whose water spray occasion-
ally blows into your face to treat you to a fresh coolness. Beyond that
lovely waterfall is more of the river, flowing on high ground from west to
east. The practice yard stretches to the north.</pre>
