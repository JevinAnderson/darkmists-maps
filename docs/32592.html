  <h1>A clean and bare room</h1>
  <pre>The earthy tunnel has come to an abrupt end at a white tiled room. There
is no sign of activity, or dirt from below.  The room itself actually feels
quit sterile.  Almost unspoiled to the point of making you feel slightly
uncomfortable lingering here. An incandescent light shines from an unknown
source, illuminating a final shimmering portal.  This one, however, appears
to be free of any dark energy, and peering through it reveals signs of life.</pre>
