  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>The soil-strewn, rock hard path curves toward the north and west, darkened by
the arching branches and their full canopy of leaves forming a tunnel. Off to
the sides of the path are many trees and shrubs, growing thick and uninhib-
ited. Flowers grow close to the ground, their light green leaves and bright
pink flowers lending color to the darkness.</pre>
