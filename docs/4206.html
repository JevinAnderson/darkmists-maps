  <h1>Library of the Crusaders</h1>
  <pre>Unfortunately, upon the destruction of the original keep, all of the
previous books and knowledge was lost from the world.  Currently, there
are only a few books on the spacious shelf.  This is a quiet room, and
sometimes Crusaders come here to just sit and meditate, in addition to
the usual reading. Amazingly enough, the destruction which seems to have
hit the rest of the Keep did not touch this room. You see not a charred
wall, not a charred bit of wood in the shelf. Near the entrances are
a few pieces of rubble from other ruined places within the Keep however.</pre>
