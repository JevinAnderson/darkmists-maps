  <h1>The Entrance of the Witch Wood</h1>
  <pre>Your uneasiness mounts as you walk along this haunted stretch of road.
The mist clears, and you find yourself in a nightmarish forest.  The
empty husk of a dead nymph lies at your feet, and on either side of you,
the trees look twisted and tortured into unnatural shapes.  The depths
of the forest sends up a hopeless cry to usher you into the woods that
ring the edge of Hell.</pre>
