The natural rock path converges here with one heading toward the
west, one toward the south, and one toward the north and east.
Looking to the east from here, you see a huge pool of water. Into
this pool the gurgling stream empties, forming a small waterfall
from this height to down there where the water is. The way down
is not safe and is not recommended to any travellers. To the south
is a stone bridge, under which the stream flows freely. During the
day, the sun breaks through the canopy of leaves here, warming the
uneven ground. The path northward slopes downward, the path south-
ward slopes upward, and the path westward remains somewhat level.</pre
