  <h1>The Eastern Bloodfall</h1>
  <pre>A huge chamber, looking to be worn out of the raw stone, lit with
but a few torches. The torches flare with raw flame, almost sentient,
alive and angry. The northwestern end of the chamber is but a pool
flowing into a tunnel of blood. The tunnel has been worn into the
wall, smooth, quiet. The blood bubbles, suggesting something beneath
the surface. Though not visible to you, it may be wise to remain at
a safe distance from whatever lurks within. The sticky ichor cascades
into the pool from above, a maroon stream of liquid. The stone you
stand upon gradually descends into the pool, there being no ledge
from the stone to the pool. The tunnel to the west is dark, uninviting,
and silent. To the west is the Central Hall, and upward descends a
rough stairway, leading to the top of the Bloodfall. A shrine of some
sort appears to the south, emanating a sickly yellow light.</pre>
