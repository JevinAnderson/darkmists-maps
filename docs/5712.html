  <h1>The Top of the Northwest Tower</h1>
  <pre>The cross winds blow you slightly about on top of the tower. From this height
all around the castle can be more than clearly viewed. The tower top is
constructed by smaller cut stones than the rest of the castle. It circles
around with large stones placed to allow an opening for sight and a block to
take cover behind. Green moss grows from the cracks of stone and a mildew
scent is carried in the air.</pre>
