  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>A high, dark canopy of green leaves arcs over the hard, soil-strewn path
beneath you. To the west is a thick wood, growing unhindered. The path
extends toward the north and south, branching to the east. Little plants with
tiny blooms grow at the side of the path, lending color with their light
green leaves and pretty red flowers. Occasionally you see a honey bee sipping
nectar from one of the small red blooms. Beyond the little plants, thick
bushes grow here, their foliage lush and green.</pre>
