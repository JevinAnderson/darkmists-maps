  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path stretches to the east and west. Clinging to the striated walls
on the north and south are naturally glowing lichen which lend light to the
passageway. Above you, the ceiling is high and dark. You hear the sounds of
activity coming from the west.</pre>
