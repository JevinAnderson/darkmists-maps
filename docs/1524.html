  <h1>General's Quarters</h1>
  <pre>The General, being the highest ranked mortal of the Covenant,
has this very large private room all to themselves.  A large,
well stuffed bed made of cherrywood, a closet for holding uniforms,
a weapons and armor rack, and a personal latrine fill the room.
The room is well lit with a glowcrystal lamp hanging from the
ceiling.</pre>
