  <h1>Outside the Wall of the Monastery</h1>
  <pre>You stand in a small clearing outside the west wall of a small
chapel within a monastery. Birdsong fills the air while butterflies
yellow and red flutter about happily. A tall large oak brings shade
further west, but all movement to the north and south is prevented by a
combination of trees and the old stone walls of the monastery. There
is a serenity and a sense of life and peace, hinting that it is often
used by others as a place of worship or contemplation.</pre>
