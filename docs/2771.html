  <h1>Pasture</h1>
  <pre>Through the enlightened methods of irrigation, the Lord of the
Manor was able to turn this edge of the desert into a lush pasture
for the use of his cattle and sheep. North is the entrance to the
Manor, and west is a row of shrubs and trees planted as a windblock.
The pasture extends east and southeast. South is a barn.</pre>
