    <pre class="room-description">There is a narrow walkway around what appears to be a gaping hole
in the ground. Ash and dust litter the ground, as if this patch of
ground once housed the very fires of hell, having burned away all
life near it. The circular walkway is made of dark stone, debris
from the meteor that devastated the land. The destruction of the Havens
has led to this rift, a rift that seems as if it once reached downward
into the depths of Hell itself. The blaze that once burned here had
been beyond any flame created by mortal means. Though the flame has
long been extinguished, one can still feel the residual heat from the
once great fire, stifling and nearly unbearable though it no longer
burns. One can make out words nearly hidden by the ash that ring the
melted rock that forms the outline of the circle. They are written
in some long-unknown tongue - words from the Lower Planes.</pre>
