  <h1>The Waterfall Glade</h1>
  <pre>A majestic waterfall pours from high above the mountains to the south.
Great torrents of water crash down on the rocks in a wide pool, and even
where you stand in a shaded glade, the wind blows sprays of water into
your face.  A profusion of flowering shrubs grow at the edge of the
pool.  In a large shaded retreat made by the overhanging branches of
silver oak trees stands a likeness of Altariel, the Lady of the Woods.
At the base of the waterfall, a rock pool with crystal clear water has
formed.</pre>
