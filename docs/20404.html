  <h1>On a dark path</h1>
  <pre>The hard rock path strewn liberally with soil branches in all cardinal direc-
tions. High trees lend a canopy cover to keep it well shaded. A few lush
green bushes grow here, their branches somehow well tended. To the north and
south the path merely stretches on through the woodland tunnel. To the west,
it slopes downward. Toward the east it leads into a woodland area, from which
you hear the sounds of battle and grunting. Near the edge of the path leading
eastward, a wooden sign stands about eye-level to a halfling.</pre>
