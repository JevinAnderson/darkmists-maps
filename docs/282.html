  <h1>In a Myrtle Shade</h1>
  <pre>You are in a clearing ringed by mulberry bushes.  You hear racuous
shouts of festivity coming from the north where the Brownie-Pixie
Bonanza is in full swing.  In the centre of the clearing is an old
Myrtle tree, under the shade of which some revellers have taken to
rest.  A lone thrush sighs from a branch of the tree.  To the west
a trail slopes gently down.</pre>
