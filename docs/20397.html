  <h1>Southern viewpoint</h1>
  <pre>The rock-hard path begins here, or ends here, depending on your point of view.
Looking to the south, you see a deep ravine through which flows a sparkling
blue river. A fence of striated zebrawood prevents the foolhardy from taking
a suicidal leap to that river far below, while at the same time lending a
comfortable place to lean and relax while enjoying the view. Gazing westward
from here, you see mostly trees, but from time to time a wispy spray of water
seems to shoot outward from beyond. You can hear the dull roar of the water-
fall which must be located to the west beyond all those trees. To the east is
a large log cabin, comfortably situated among the trees. A thin wisp of smoke
rises from a short chimney in the wood-shingled roof, and you smell the very
distinctive scent of meat cooking.</pre>
