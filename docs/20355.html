    <pre class="room-description">Three solid walls of grey and brown striated stone are spottily covered with
softly glowing lichen. The southern wall opens through a vaulted arch into
the tunnels. In here, however, is one of the finest food shops in Thera. A
cooking pit at the west wall contains a steady fire, and cauldrons hang over
it, steam rising from them. The steam, and smoke from the flames below, rise
upward into a conic opening in the ceiling. A smooth counter rises up from
the floor. Here the cooks prepare the food for cooking or for packaging for
folk to take home with them. A list of the foods sold here hangs against the
eastern wall.</pre>
