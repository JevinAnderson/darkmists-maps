  <h1>A Lovely Trail</h1>
  <pre>You are following a faint north-south trail in the Emerald Forest.
Swallows and Bluebirds fill the air with song and laughter, and you
spy a small red-breast Robin sitting motionless on a branch on one of
the oak trees. The serenity of this forest is amazing, you feel at
peace and safe, as though you just stepped into a fairy tale where
the knights kill all the trolls, and nobody stays hungry. It's hard
not to day dream, walking here.</pre>
