  <h1>A Dark Hallway</h1>
  <pre>The hallway is fairly bland and the only things to see are the
everburning torches lining the walls.  It is very quiet in here,
the only sounds that can be heard are the echoes from your own
movements.  A ladder made of what appears to be darkened mithril
leads upwards and downwards.  Two doorways, one to the east and
one to the west lead off into other parts of the fortress.</pre>
