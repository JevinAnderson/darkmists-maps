  <h1>Commissary</h1>
  <pre>This room is split north to south by a low wooden counter. The wood is
a light and well polished oak, but has been stained all over with
patches of a dark, crusty substance. The stone floor bears similar
stains- this whole area could use a thorough cleaning. Behind the
counter, all manner of boxes and crates have been haphazardly stacked.
Some open, some closed, many empty, they contain the bulk of the
Justicar provisions. A sign on the counter lists all the items
currently available to the lawmen.</pre>
