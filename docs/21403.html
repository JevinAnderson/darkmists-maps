  <h1>Center Womb</h1>
  <pre>The interior is dimmer than in the room close to the entrance; sunlight
is non-existent here, reducing visibility for most creatures.  There are
some dark spots in the ceiling where the limestone seems almost black
with soot, and some parts where the glittering water droplets provide
an eerie lighting to the gloomy surroundings.  The cave interior starts
to narrow as sharp rocks jut out from every corner.  Halfway down the
cavern hefty boulders converge from opposing sides towards the center.
The silty ground further slopes to a decline, allowing liquids to spiral
downwards and accumulate into a filthy pool.  The large crevices on the
rectangular rock columns to the left and right of you, close to the cave-
wall, seem passable.</pre>
