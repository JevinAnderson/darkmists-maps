  <h1>Armory</h1>
  <pre>A majority of the heavy weaponry and armor of the Covenant is kept
here in locked weapons lockers.  The entire room is well lit and
each locker is polished to a gleaming shine.  The armor and weapons
not located in the lockers are arranged neatly on weapon and armor
stands.</pre>
