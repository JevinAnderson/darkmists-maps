  <h1>Entrance to the Great House</h1>
  <pre>The great house is richly furnished with the finery the Lord
collected during his youth as a Crusader. While he no longer
serves the Crusade actively, he has not given up his beliefs
in the purity of a soul untainted by magic, and a body well-
honed by hard work and physical exertion. On the wall near the
door is a tapestry with words woven in gold thread on a dark
blue background, framed with green vines and leaves. To the north
is the library, to the south a sitting room.</pre>
