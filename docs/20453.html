    <h1 class="room-header">Huge log house</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">This house was built from logs from wood from a forest far away. The
logs themselves are stripped of their bark inside here, showing off
a nicely polished light-hued wood with dark-striped grain. The furn-
iture is all made of the same zebrawood, one of the stronger woods
in the world. If the outside of this house seemed huge, the inside
seems much larger. Two beds in the far corners are constructed of a
size capable of allowing two giants to sleep upon them. A table in
the middle of the house is surrounded by four chairs, all of them
scaled for a giant's comfort. You do notice one chair has an extra
'seat' set upon it, higher up, so as to allow someone of a smaller
sized race to sit comfortably at the table with the giants. That
chair has a nice cushion on it, too, made of brocaded cloth and
stuffed almost to bursting. A fireplace with a thick chimney, all
made from cast iron or some other strong, dark metal, serves as the
focal point of the kitchen area. A number of knives, forks, and
spoons hang nearby, and a stained table shows where butchering and
meal preparation is done.</pre>
