  <h1>Along the garden path</h1>
  <pre>The natural rock path turns toward the north and east here,
uneven on uneven ground sloping downward toward the west and
north, sloping upward toward the east. Looking toward the
north, you see a rock face cliff, from the craggy side of
which a few die-hard trees, very small in size, have attempted
to grow. The field of dark green ivy has given way to lush
green grass, soft to walk upon. The trees here are a mixture
of those thin trunked trees with smooth, grey peeling bark, or
thicker trees of maple and elm, their dark brown bark very
rough to the touch.</pre>
