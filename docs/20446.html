  <h1>Dirt path through the wild woodland</h1>
  <pre>Pushing past the shrubbery growing thick in this region, you find a crude
dirt path leading westward. Those who planned the natural city did not set
this path here. You notice that the path branches here, one fork heading
due north, one fork heading due south, the other due west to a huge,
shadowy tree stump rising up about forty feet before having been cut square
across the top. This stump appears to have been hollowed out, and is large
enough that a giant can enter it without trouble. Thick, soft moss covers
most of its dark brown bark. The path to the north appears to be dark and
foreboding.</pre>
