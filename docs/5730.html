    <h1 class="room-header">Altar to Nature</h1>
    <pre class="room-description">This space further connects to the Green Room. It is barely noticeable where
one room begins and the other ends. Plants, vines, flowers, and vegetation of
all sorts grow plentiful here. A strange wooden altar is built to honor true
nature. A sense of purity with the land is felt while one is near the altar.
On either side of the altar are natural wooden tables, as though they grew as
such, their legs rooted into the ground. Upon those tables are small potted
oak trees, bonsai of great age and beauty. Their leaves are tiny replicas of
full-sized oak leaves, golden in color.</pre>
