  <h1>Bottom of a Strange Tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The ethereal webbing clinging to the walls hangs loftily here, offering
a means of egress.  What appears to be a small pit has been carved out
of the earth here, and a large pool of slime collects at the base. The
stench of decay and fermentation, mixed with body odor, skunk, and other
nauseating scents is enough to turn even the most seasoned of stomachs.
There appears to be nothing else special about this chamber but your eyes
are drawn to a humming and crackling portal hovering just above the pit
of slime.  Perhaps you can make the jump through from your vantage point
on the wall.</pre>
