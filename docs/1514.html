  <h1>General Stockroom</h1>
  <pre>The stockroom is filled with dozens upon dozens of shelves, each
one filled with assorted things that are needed by an army.
Tents, canteens, dry rations and other things are available.
The quartermaster sits behind a counter in the middle of the
room and you notice a sign on the counter.  To the west is
a room filled with massive iron cabinets.</pre>
