  <h1>Behind the Silver Gate</h1>
  <pre>As you enter this dark passage, you see smooth stone walls of a
clay red hue lined with flickering dark blue wax candles in shiny
silver sconces. Between each candle are tapestries depicting the
deep blue rose whose green, thorny stem ends in a quill tip. In
each tapestry the quill tip appears to have written words upon a
parchment. The first one on the right says, 'Love'. The first on
the left says, 'Loyalty'. The second on the right says, 'Diplomacy',
and the second on the left says, 'Natural Power.' The floor is of
the same clay red stone as the walls. The ceiling, however, is so
high you cannot see it, but you know it is there.</pre>
