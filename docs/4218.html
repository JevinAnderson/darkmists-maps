  <h1>A Fiery Passage</h1>
  <pre>You stand in the midst of a wide orange-glowing tunnel. Flames dance and
lick at your extremities with tempered restraint, as if some dark and foul
host wishes you only slightly roasted before enjoying you as an entire meal
in the not too distant future.  You might find such a fate if you continue
through this passage to the north.</pre>
