  <h1>A bend in the path of polished stone</h1>
  <pre>The stone beneath you is polished almost to a perfect shine. There are
few imperfections, if any at all, in the stone here. The rock wall forms
an overhang, a sort of ceiling, above you, and you are protected from a
straight downfall of water. There is such a downfall of water to your
west, but remaining on the path of polished stone will prevent you being
dashed to the rocks below which sit in the clear blue spring of water.
The path continues to the west and to the south.</pre>
