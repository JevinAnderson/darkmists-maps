  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The path leads northward to a widening of the cavern, and southward to an
alcove beyond a vaulted opening, through which bright yet soft light seems
to emanate. Peering southward through that vaulted opening, you see a dark
shape amid the brilliant glow of gold and orange lichen, a dark shape that
resembles an anvil and yet is not being used as such. On the striated walls
to the east and west, here, you see glowing lichen clinging, lending a soft
light to your passage.</pre>
