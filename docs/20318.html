  <h1>Path within the tunnel</h1>
  <pre>The stony path leads north and south, and the walls of striated stone on the
east and west lend light due to the lichen clinging to them. Lichen clings
also to the ceiling, but the floor is of dark stone and well trodden: No
lichen grows there. To the north the cavern seems to open up. To the south is
a straight path.</pre>
