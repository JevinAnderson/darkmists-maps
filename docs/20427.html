  <h1>By the pond</h1>
  <pre>The hard soil-strewn path stretches toward the east and west. To the north is
a crystalline blue pond, its waters mostly still. Water herbs grow along the
edge of the pond. Along the path, the grass is green and healthy. Occasionally
you notice a little movement just beneath the surface of the pond water, and
you can make out some silvery fish swimming. Toward the south is a dark,
lovely forest.</pre>
