  <h1>The Torture Wing</h1>
  <pre>At the center of this blackened out cave is a bizarre sight. A bubbling and
oozing unnatural "spring" of crimson blood surges forth, swallowing up the
cave surface.  Bloody footprints from all manner of foul creatures have been
tracked across the floor, leading to and from an array of despicable torture
devices. Strangely, there is no evidence of any insects or critters within
this place, as if some dark force has prhobited their presence here. Blackened
iron torches hang from sconces in the wall, flickering in an eerie fashion
that causes the shadows to dance with glee at the horrid suffering that
takes place here. Only the most depraved souls in all of Thera could possibly
stomach spending more than an instant in this unholy place before losing their
lunch...and any sense of hope and humanity.</pre>
