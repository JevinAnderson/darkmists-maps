You are within a small, broken tower. A cracked, spiral stair leads up to
nowhere, for there is no upper level. The walls on this level are smashed so
that you can see outside toward the dark and skeletal trees. In the center of
this ground level is a large throne formed entirely of skulls, their socket-
less eyes staring at you. On either side of the throne, a crackling brazier
stands, causing the shadows to writhe and dance as though alive. What is left
of the walls are covered with bookshelves full of countless dusty books and
tomes. High on the cracked wall behind the throne, one of the few patches
where the stones still look sturdy, is a massive bronze relief: a rapier
crossing a war gauntlet.</pre
