  <h1>Bedroom</h1>
  <pre>This bedroom is a child's bedroom. A small bed sits against the
eastern wall. Near it is a small table, upon which is a nearly
spent candle in a small dish, the wax about to drip over the
edges. There are toys on the floor. The door is hooked to the
wall, remaining open. Perhaps the child once locked himself in
and the Lord and Lady wish to prevent another such occurrance?</pre>
