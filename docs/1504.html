  <h1>A Dark Hallway</h1>
  <pre>The hallway is fairly bland and the only things to see are the
everburning torches lining the walls.  It is very quiet in here,
the only sounds that can be heard are the echoes from your own
movements.  To the west is a doorway leading to a room filled with
bookshelves and to the east leads to a room with dozens of
ceremonial weapons and shields hanging on the walls.</pre>
