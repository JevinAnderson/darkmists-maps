  <h1>Within the Halls of Valor</h1>
  <pre>The halls of the castle are simple yet elegant.  A finely woven blue
carpet runs down the middle of the walkway.  Small crosses in a darker
hue of blue are sewn into the carpet at equal intervals.  Beautiful
white marble tile can be seen to either side of the carpet.  Torches
are lit along the hallway giving off a flickering illumination.  Upon
the Eastern wall a beautiful tapestry hangs.  The scene of a great feast
is shown here.  Knights, squires, and the villagers all taking part in
a merry celebration. A set of stairs lead up from the corner of the room
into a turret above.</pre>
