  <h1>The Vault</h1>
  <pre>The stairs descending into this vault are made of the same
unbroken white marble that is in the main hallway. The swirls
and patterns of the marble suddenly stop as the stairs meet
the floor. The walls of the room are lined with lockers and
indentations, places to store the wealth of the Marauders.</pre>
