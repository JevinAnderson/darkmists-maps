  <h1>A Decrepit Kitchen</h1>
  <pre>The reality that anyone would ever want to eat in this kitchen is
revolting.  Grime and sludge mar every surface, to the point where
you're more likely to die from some disease than to find anything
to eat.  A few candles illuminate this disgusting scene, though
perhaps you wish they had not.  The Syndicate clearly isn't in the
business of hosting people, though they did need some way to keep
more longterm assets fed.  A solitary window in the north wall
displays the fallen city of Arkham, and a small measure of light
on that side of the room.  The archway to the north leads to the
staircase.</pre>
