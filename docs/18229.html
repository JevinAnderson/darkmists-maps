    <pre class="room-description">The natural rock path veers northward and westward. Toward
the north, it is even, on level ground. Toward the west,
however, the rock path is uneven, covering ground which
slopes downward. To the northwest, a well-kept flowerbed
sits beside the path, and beyond it, a field of dark green
ivy with leaves measuring about five inches across. Amidst
the ivy, thin trunked trees rise up, lending an intermittant
shade from their canopy of leaves. The bark of those trees
is of light grey and very smooth, except where nature has
chosen to peel it away in paper-thin layers. To the east, a
stream of water gurgles northward. Its origin seems to be
within a field of ivy, perhaps a natural spring coming up
from the ground amid the vines.</pre>
