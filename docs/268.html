  <h1>The Honey Bun</h1>
  <pre>Two lines of pixies and brownies stand facing one another yelling
and hooting in excitement. They seem to be deep in a game of
'Pixie, Brownie and Honey Bun'. A small bag filled with pipeweed
seed is placed squarely in the middle of the line, while both teams
are numbered off. A number is called, and the respective brownie
or pixie has to run forward, grab the bag and return to the line
without being touched. Looks like great fun.</pre>
