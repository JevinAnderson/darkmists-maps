  <h1>The Massive Cavern of the Lord of Fear</h1>
  <pre>The walls broaden and part here to reveal a room full of
light from a staircase leading to the top of what appears
to be a tower built through the top of the cavern. The
floor of the cavern is lined with beautiful rugs of many
different cultures. Upon the walls hang tapestries alive
with many different hues.</pre>
