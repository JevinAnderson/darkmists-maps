  <h1>Workshop</h1>
  <pre>Covenant soldiers must know how to use and maintain weapons and
armor as part of their training, but sometimes, weapons and armor
simply break from extended use.  Rather than completely depend
on an outside source completely for standard armaments, the
Covenant has built this workshop to produce any type of armor or
weaponry, provided the smiths have the materials they need.
This lets the Covenant soldiers not have to worry about running
into battle totally helpless due to a lack of equipment.</pre>
